79146412,LINQPad 8 Dump Property Order different that LINQPad 5,"In LINQPad 5 with Linq-to-Sql DataContext, if I dump out a table.

In LINQPad 8 with EF Core DbContext objects, if I dump out the same table, the properties are always dumped in alphabetical order vs the order of property declaration in the scaffolded class.
Is there a way to make it dump based on order of declaration?

The screenshot shows the problem, but I'll provide a detailed description of the issue and the relevant code/IDE context.

**Issue Description:**

The UI is not rendering correctly, with some elements overlapping or not displaying at all. The screenshot shows the problem, but I'll provide a detailed description of the issue and the relevant code/IDE context.

**Relevant Code/IDE Context:**

I'm using Visual Studio Code as my IDE, and the project is built using React and TypeScript. The relevant code snippet is as follows:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

**Expected Behavior:**

I expect the UI to render correctly, with all elements displaying as intended. The expected behavior is that the `h1` and `p` elements should be displayed on separate lines, with no overlap.

**Actual Behavior:**

The actual behavior is that the `h1` and `p` elements are overlapping, with the `p` element being displayed on top of the `h1` element. This is not the expected behavior, and I'm not sure what's causing the issue.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

To reproduce the issue, simply create a new React project using Visual Studio Code and paste the above code into the `App.tsx` file. Then, run the application using `npm start` and observe the UI rendering issue.

**System Configuration:**

* Operating System: Windows 10
* IDE: Visual Studio Code
* Framework: React
* Language: TypeScript

I've tried debugging the issue by checking the console logs and inspecting the DOM elements, but I couldn't find any obvious errors or issues. I've also tried updating the dependencies and cleaning the project, but the issue persists.

If anyone has any ideas or suggestions on how to resolve this issue, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you for your time and assistance."

}) as <E extends ElementType = 'div'>(props: BoxProps<E>) => JSX.Element;

For the handleOnClick callback, I assigned the event in the callback the HTMLElement type from @types/react-dom because it is the parent of all possible HTML dom elements and was generic enough to satisfy TypeScript.
But, I now specifically need access to the event.currentTarget property.

The only way I know of to make TypeScript aware of the currentTarget property is to change HTMLElement to a more specific type, like HTMLButtonElement. But that breaks polymorphism because the developer could pick a tag like ""a"" which means I would need to change the callback event type to HTMLAnchorElement
Is there a generic React Typescript type for HTMLElement that accepts a tag string?  Like HTMLElement<'button'>. I'm just not aware of a generic type that can allow me to set the event conditionally based on an HTML tag name.

Question: Is there a way to adjust VS Code settings or install specific plugins to reduce IntelliSense verbosity for Node.js functions, specifically to show only essential information?

However, I'm encountering an error when trying to create a server using the http.createServer() method.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

```javascript
const http = require('http');
const routes = require('./routes');

const server = http.createServer(routes.handler);

server.listen(3000, function() {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```

The expected behavior is that the server should start listening on port 3000 without any errors. However, the actual behavior is that the server throws an error when trying to create the server instance.

I've tried debugging the issue by checking the routes.handler function, but it seems to be correct. I've also checked the server.listen() method, but it's also correct.

I'm using Node.js version 14.17.0 and the http module version 0.0.0. I've also tried updating the http module to the latest version, but the issue persists.

**Description:**

I am experiencing an issue with my React application where the `useState` hook is not behaving as expected. The screenshot below illustrates the problem:

[Insert Screenshot]

**Code:**

**Expected Behavior:**

When the user clicks the ""Increment"" button, I expect the `count` state variable to increment by 1, and the updated value to be displayed on the screen.

**Actual Behavior:**

However, when I click the ""Increment"" button, the `count` state variable does not update, and the displayed value remains at 0. The screenshot shows the error message in the console.

**Environment:**

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Create a new React project using `create-react-app`.
2. Replace the contents of `App.js` with the code above.
3. Run the application using `npm start`.
4. Click the ""Increment"" button.

**Error Message:**

The error message in the console is:

The screenshot shows the problem, but I'll provide more context and code to help you understand the issue.

**Context:**

I have a simple React component that displays a list of items. When the user clicks on an item, I want to update the state to reflect the selected item. However, the state is not being updated correctly, and I'm getting an error message.

**Code:**

Here is the relevant code snippet:
```jsx

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [selectedItem, setSelectedItem] = useState(null);

  const handleItemClick = (item) => {
    setSelectedItem(item);

};
```
**Expected Behavior:**

When the user clicks on an item, I expect the `selectedItem` state to be updated with the clicked item's data. The `Selected Item` paragraph should display the name of the selected item.

**Actual Behavior:**

Instead of updating the state, I'm getting an error message that says ""Cannot read property 'name' of null"". The `Selected Item` paragraph remains empty.

**Error Message:**

The error message is not very helpful, but it seems to be related to the `selectedItem` state being null. I've tried debugging the code, but I'm not sure what's causing the issue.

**Additional Information:**

* I'm using React 17.0.2 and JavaScript ES6 syntax.
* I've tried using the `useEffect` hook to update the state, but it didn't make a difference.
* I've also tried using the `console.log` statement to print the `selectedItem` state, but it always logs `null`.

The screenshot shows the problem, but I'll provide more context to help you understand the issue.

**Relevant Code:**

I'm using a combination of React, Redux, and Material-UI to build my application. The relevant code snippet is as follows:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { Grid, Typography } from '@material-ui/core';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const data = useSelector((state) => state.data);

  return (
    <Grid container spacing={2}>
      {data.map((item, index) => (
        <Grid item key={index} xs={12} sm={6} md={4} lg={3}>
          <Typography variant=""h6"">{item.name}</Typography>
          <Typography variant=""body1"">{item.description}</Typography>
        </Grid>
      ))}
    </Grid>
  );
};

export default connect()(MyComponent);
```

**Expected Behavior:**

I expect the data to be displayed in a grid layout with each item having a name and description. The data is fetched from an API and stored in the Redux store.

**Actual Behavior:**

However, when I run the application, the data is not being displayed at all. The screenshot shows a blank page with no errors in the console. I've checked the network requests and the data is being fetched correctly, but it's not being rendered on the page.

**Additional Context:**

I've tried debugging the issue by adding console logs and checking the Redux store, but I couldn't find any issues. I've also tried using a different component library, but the issue persists.

**Question:**

Can someone help me identify the issue and provide a solution? I've been stuck on this problem for hours and would appreciate any guidance."
79143556,How to get accurate code coverage report using gcovr for MSYS2 MINGW64 Clang project?,"I try to use gcovr tool to obtain code coverage of a C++ project built on Windows using MSYS2 MINGW64's Clang toolchain.
I've decided to use such setup to mimic how the project is built on the CI system.
The project consists of a test executable E (it uses GoogleTest framework) and two static libraries, L1 and L2, having the following dependencies: L1 -> L2; L1, L2 -> E.
It is build using CMake system.
When building for code coverage, at the very beginning of the whole process I append to all targets the following compiler flags (CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS): -g --coverage -fPIC -O0 -fno-elide-constructors
Then, I generate code coverage report using the following command:
-- C:/msys64/mingw64/bin/gcovr.exe --html index.html --html-details -r <PROJECT_ROOT> --object-directory=<BUILD_DIR> --gcov-executable=llvm-cov gcov --merge-mode-functions=merge-use-line-min --exclude-unreachable-branches --exclude-function-lines --exclude-lines-by-pattern '^\s*\}?\s*$'
The first problem I've encountered is that for at least one source file some functions were found on multiple lines in the same file - what makes no sense to me, as e.g. gcovr reported one of such functions to start in L183 and L185, whereas it actually starts in L185 and L183 contains the closing brace of totally different function. I have no clue why I got this error, but managed to bypass it by using --merge-mode-functions=merge-use-line-min flag.
However, the resulting report is garbage. In particular, numerous empty lines as well as lines containing only comments/closing braces are marked as ""not hit"" what makes the output rather not useful.
Note that I've used --exclude-lines-by-pattern '^\s*\}?\s*$' flag, but for some reason it did not filter out the mentioned problematic lines.
Here is an excerpt from the generated report:

What should I do to make the results more accurate? Use different compiler/linker flags? A different coverage tool?
A different toolchain is not so feasible solution, as then I would have to constantly rebuild the whole project to switch between e.g. Clang <-> GCC.
I've tried to add -Xclang -fprofile-instrument=clang compiler flags to all build targets, but then the build process was stuck at linking my test executable E (or the process was slowed down, that I assumed it became staled; instead of completing let's say in 10-20 seconds, it did not finished even after a few minutes). 
[EDIT: It finished after some 15-20 minutes, with a long list of ""undefined reference"" errors occuring for GoogleTest library (libgtest.a) and related to elements of C++ standard library, e.g.:
C:/msys64/mingw64/bin/ld: lib/libgtest.a(gtest-all.cc.obj):C:/msys64/mingw64/include/c++/14.2.0/bits/stl_tree.h:1964: more undefined references to '__profc__ZNKSt8_Rb_treeINSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEES5_St9_IdentityIS5_ESt4lessIS5_ESaIS5_EE14_M_lower_boundEPKSt13_Rb_tree_nodeIS5_EPKSt18_Rb_tree_node_baseRKS5_' follow

",['https://i.sstatic.net/AJzeUB68.png'],Error in Rendering Ellipse: Incorrect Eccentricity Calculation Causes Distortion,"I'm experiencing an issue with my project where the ellipse is not being rendered as expected. The screenshot shows the problem, but I'll provide more context to help you understand the issue.

**Relevant Code:**

I'm using OpenCV to render the ellipse. Here's the relevant code snippet:
```cpp
#include <opencv2/opencv.hpp>

int main() {
    // Create a window
    cv::namedWindow(""Ellipse"", cv::WINDOW_NORMAL);

    // Create a Mat object
    cv::Mat image = cv::Mat::zeros(400, 400, CV_8UC3);

    // Define the ellipse parameters
    cv::Point center(200, 200);
    cv::Size axes(100, 50);
    double angle = 0;
    int startAngle = 0;
    int endAngle = 360;

    // Draw the ellipse
    cv::ellipse(image, center, axes, angle, startAngle, endAngle, cv::Scalar(0, 255, 0), 2);

    // Display the image
    cv::imshow(""Ellipse"", image);
    cv::waitKey(0);
    cv::destroyAllWindows();

    return 0;
}
```
**Expected Behavior:**

I expect the ellipse to be rendered as a circle, with the major axis length equal to the value of `axes.width` (100) and the minor axis length equal to the value of `axes.height` (50). The ellipse should be centered at the point `(200, 200)`.

**Actual Behavior:**

However, the actual output shows an ellipse with a distorted shape, where the major axis length is not equal to the value of `axes.width` (100) and the minor axis length is not equal to the value of `axes.height` (50). The ellipse is also not centered at the point `(200, 200)`.

**Additional Information:**

I've tried adjusting the values of `axes`, `angle`, `startAngle`, and `endAngle`, but the issue persists. I've also checked the documentation for `cv::ellipse` and ensured that I'm using the correct syntax.

**Question:**

What could be causing this issue, and how can I fix it to render the ellipse correctly?"

So when I moved a copy of the codebase and opened the solution, VS asked for updating the codebase to .NET 4.8 and that's all updated. Once updating the codebase, session setting in web.config:

79139703,How can I show an unauthorized view when HttpClient gets 403 from calling API in .NET Blazor Web Assembly?,"Basically here is my scenario that I'm going to achieve:

I have two users: A and B, A has the permission to access my Restful API developed with ASP.NET Core Web API, B doesn't have the permission to access that API resource (API will return 403)
In my Blazor Web Assembly app, there is a page which will read data from this Restful API, so, I would like when A user logs in, s/he can access this page correctly, but when B logs in, since B doesn't have the access to the API, therefore, when the page is loading and reading data from API, the page will get 403 error and should instead show something like ""You don't have permission to access the page""

So, in the OnInitializedAsync method of the Blazor page, it uses injected IHttpClientFactory to create an HttpClient, and makes a call to the API:
using var httpClient = HttpClientFactory.CreateClient(""stickersHttpClient"");
var httpResponseMessage = await httpClient.GetAsync($""api/stickers?page={pageNumber}&size={pageSize}"");
httpResponseMessage.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
var responseJson = await httpResponseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
PageContent = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<StickersPage>(responseJson);

If it is user B who opens this page, the httpClient.GetAsync will definitely return 403 error, but instead of showing a ""You don't have permission to view this page"" error on the page, the page actually reported an error in the console:

I have already applied @attribute [Authorize] on the page, and in the App.razor it has the following authorized view settings:
<CascadingAuthenticationState>
    <Router AppAssembly=""@typeof(App).Assembly"">
        <Found Context=""routeData"">
            <AuthorizeRouteView RouteData=""@routeData"" DefaultLayout=""@typeof(MainLayout)"">
                <NotAuthorized>
                    @if (context.User.Identity?.IsAuthenticated != true)
                    {
                        <RedirectToLogin />
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        <p role=""alert"">You don't have permission to view this page.</p>
                    }
                </NotAuthorized>
            </AuthorizeRouteView>
            <FocusOnNavigate RouteData=""@routeData"" Selector=""h1"" />
        </Found>
        <NotFound>
            <PageTitle>Not found</PageTitle>
            <LayoutView Layout=""@typeof(MainLayout)"">
                <p role=""alert"">Sorry, there's nothing at this address.</p>
            </LayoutView>
        </NotFound>
    </Router>
</CascadingAuthenticationState>

I think there should be some gap between the API and the page, there should be the way allowing my razor page to ""know"" about the 403 returned by the API so that it could apply the routed authentication view. But I don't know how can I do that.
(By the way, the authorization of the user is done against Keycloak with the policy based on user roles)

**Description:**

I'm experiencing a puzzling issue with my React application, where a blue border appears unexpectedly around certain elements. Despite my best efforts, I've been unable to identify the cause of this behavior.

**Relevant Code:**

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div className=""container"">
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

**Expected Behavior:**

I expect the component to render without any additional borders or styling.

**Actual Behavior:**

The component renders with a blue border around the `h1` and `p` elements, as shown in the screenshot below:

[Insert Screenshot]

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Create a new React project using `create-react-app`.
2. Replace the contents of `App.js` with the code above.
3. Run the application using `npm start`.
4. Observe the unexpected blue border around the `h1` and `p` elements.

**Environment:**

* React version: 17.0.2
* Node version: 14.17.0
* Browser: Google Chrome 92.0.4515.107

**What I've Tried:**

* Inspecting the element in the browser dev tools to identify any CSS rules that may be causing the border.
* Checking the component's props and state to ensure there are no unexpected values.
* Searching for similar issues on Stack Overflow and GitHub.

I'm stumped and would appreciate any guidance on how to resolve this issue. Thank you for your help!

79132115,Run Roboelectric in Unit Testing and Most Efficient way to perform instrument test at physical device,"I'm doing some old codelab on testing here, But in the codelab it uses Roboelectric in UnitTest folder, but when I run that it stuck on this part

Here's the code.

class TasksViewModelTest {

    // Subject under test
    private lateinit var tasksViewModel: TasksViewModel

    // Executes each task synchronously using Architecture Components.
    @get:Rule

    @Before
    fun setupViewModel() {
        tasksViewModel = TasksViewModel(ApplicationProvider.getApplicationContext())
    }


    @Test
    fun addNewTask_setsNewTaskEvent() {

        // When adding a new task
        tasksViewModel.addNewTask()

        // Then the new task event is triggered

            value.getContentIfNotHandled(), (not(nullValue()))

        assertThat(tasksViewModel.tasksAddViewVisible.getOrAwaitValue(), `is`(true))
    }

}

Well I know that the purpose of the UnitTest is to run the test faster, I on the later codelab it stated that it's faster to mock / fake the repository and pass it to the viewModel rather than using context and instantiate the viewModel (which remove the AndroidJUnit4 test runner) and remove the roboelectric test that takes ages to run.

My question is that so does the Roboelectric fall into the Instrumented test (which belong to the AndroidTest folder) or the unitTest, because it seems I can't run the test because it hang indefinately.

Also my other question, is how to setup your physical device for instrument and end to end testing efficiently. In many cases, you need to install the app, activate the Display pop up windows while running background for each app and run the testing. Does there any alternative way of doing the instrument / end to end testing in the physical device?


Thanks for reading this. And It will probably my reminder to doing testing in the future
I look up at some SO question about running test on physical device, but none of that are satisfy my question.

The issue I am having is that when I open my PgAdmin4 for postgres and connect to my database, I can see those 3 tables in my schema view but when I use a select statement to query data from the table it keeps returning an error that the table cannot be found

Other tables I created using the GUI are working fine, I need assistance on how I can get this working...I can provide further clarifications if needed.
",['https://i.sstatic.net/2f4Hgd7M.png'],"Error in PostgreSQL Query: ""SELECT * FROM Posts"" Returns No Results Despite Data Existence","I'm experiencing an issue with my project where the data output is not being displayed as expected. The screenshot shows the problem, but I'll provide more context to help you understand the issue.

**Relevant Code:**

I'm using Python 3.9 and the pandas library to manipulate the data. Here's the relevant code snippet:
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Process the data
df = df.groupby('category')['value'].sum().reset_index()

# Display the data
print(df)
```
**Expected Behavior:**

I expect the data output to be displayed in a table format with two columns: `category` and `value`. The `category` column should contain unique values, and the `value` column should contain the sum of values for each category.

**Actual Behavior:**

However, when I run the code, the data output is not displayed at all. The screenshot shows a blank page with no error messages or warnings.

**Additional Context:**

I've checked the data file and it's in the correct format. I've also tried running the code in a different environment, but the issue persists. I'm using the latest version of pandas and Python.

**Question:**

Can someone help me identify the issue and provide a solution to display the data output correctly? I've tried debugging the code, but I'm not sure what's causing the problem. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated."

79131326,Does EF Core supports `ComplexType` under `Owned` property?,"I'm using ComplexTypeAttribute for some data columns that I want to group together like:
[ComplexType]
public record TrashData(DateTime? Value)
{
    public Identity By { get; init; } = Identity.Unknown;

    private string _reason = string.Empty;
    public string? Reason
    {
        get => _reason;
        init => _reason = string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(value) ? string.Empty : value;
    }

    private static readonly TrashData _available = new TrashData((DateTime?)null);
    public static TrashData Available => _available;
}
[ComplexType]
public record Identity(string IdKind = ""GUID"", string? Value = null)
{
  public static readonly Identity Unknown = new(""_"",""_"");
}

I found no issue adding ComplexType inside another one.
But when I added a ComplexType inside an Owned property like the following:
//(I'm using Asp Identity)
public class User : IdentityUser
{
    public required UserMetaData MetaData { get; set; } = new(default);
}
[Owned]
public record UserMetaData(string Id)
{
    public TrashData Trashed_ { get; set; } = TrashData.Available;
}

I had build issues after generating migration:

I tried to manually specify this property is complex using Fluent Method like this, but it doesn't seem to exist there:
builder.Entity<User>(e =>
{
//  e.ComplexProperty(x => x.MetaData.Trashed_); // Can call ComplexProperty

    e.OwnsOne(
        x => x.MetaData,
        o =>
        {
            o.WithOwner().HasPrincipalKey(x => x.Id).HasForeignKey(x => x.Id);
            // o.ComplexProperty(x => x.Trashed_); // Can't call complex property here.
        }
    );
}

So does EF Core 8 support complex type inside owned property, or not yet?
Note: Migration is generated against SQLite.

In the screenshot, you can see that the compiler is complaining about the ""OwnedNavigationBuilder"" not being a definition for ""ComplexPropertyDictionary<string, object>"". However, I have defined the ""OwnedNavigationBuilder"" class and it should be recognized as a valid type.

Expected behavior: The compiler should recognize the ""OwnedNavigationBuilder"" as a valid type and allow me to use it in the ""ComplexPropertyDictionary<string, object>"".

Actual behavior: The compiler is throwing an error saying that the ""OwnedNavigationBuilder"" is not a definition for ""ComplexPropertyDictionary<string, object>"".

I've tried checking the namespace and ensuring that the ""OwnedNavigationBuilder"" class is properly defined, but I'm still getting this error. Any help would be appreciated."

",['https://i.sstatic.net/z1YwbLo5.png'],"** Unhandled Exception in ASP.NET MVC Application: ""System.Web.HttpException"" with Inner Exception ""System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException""","I'm experiencing an issue with my project where the IDE is not recognizing the import statement for the `numpy` library. The screenshot shows the error message ""Unresolved reference 'numpy'"" in the IDE. 

Here is the relevant code snippet:

```python

I have tried reinstalling the `numpy` library using pip, but the issue persists. I have also checked that the `numpy` library is installed in the correct Python environment. 

Expected behavior: The IDE should recognize the `numpy` import statement and allow me to use its functions without any errors. 

Actual behavior: The IDE throws an ""Unresolved reference 'numpy'"" error when I try to import the `numpy` library. 

I would appreciate any help in resolving this issue. 

Note: I am using Python 3.9 and the latest version of the IDE. 

Please let me know if you need any additional information or context. 

Thanks in advance for your assistance. 

**Edit:** I have tried restarting the IDE and invalidating the cache, but the issue still persists.

79130607,Why does the Bulma CSS framwork change the z-index on hover?,"I am looking into rendering performance issues of my website and I have found that I get a lot of repaints while just moving the mouse pointer around.
Example: the HTML-Box below the input field and button get a repaint each time I move the mouse pointer (hovering only) between the input and the button in this page (from the official Bulma docs)

I am using the Bulma CSS framework with an ""add-on""-arrangement on some elements. A deeper analysis has show that such buttons and inputs have their z-index changed on hover. The relevant scss code in Bulma is this:
From tools.scss:
  .#{iv.$class-prefix}button,
  .#{iv.$class-prefix}input,
  .#{iv.$class-prefix}select select {
    &:not([disabled]) {
      &:hover,
      &.#{iv.$class-prefix}is-hovered {
        z-index: 2;
      }

      &:focus,
      &.#{iv.$class-prefix}is-focused,
      &:active,
      &.#{iv.$class-prefix}is-active {
        z-index: 3;

        &:hover {
          z-index: 4;
        }
      }
    }
  }

What is the logic behind such a z-index change on hover?
It's causing a ton of repaints on my quite complex website. Do other CSS frameworks have a similar function? I am tempted to remove/neuter these z-index changes.
",['https://i.sstatic.net/ykeZwCx0.png'],** Unexpected Layout Issue: Misaligned Elements in Responsive Design,"I'm experiencing an issue with my project where the search functionality is not working as expected. The screenshot shows the problem, but I'll provide more context to help you understand the issue.

**Relevant Code:**

```html
<div class=""field has-addons"">
  <div class=""control"">
    <input class=""input"" type=""text"" placeholder=""Find a repository"" />
  </div>
  <div class=""control"">
    <button class=""button is-info"">

    </button>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Expected Behavior:**

When I enter a search query and click the ""Search"" button, I expect the page to display a list of relevant results. However, instead of showing the results, the page remains blank.

**Actual Behavior:**

As shown in the screenshot, when I enter a search query and click the ""Search"" button, the page does not display any results. The page remains blank, and there are no error messages or indicators that something went wrong.

**Additional Context:**

I've checked the browser console for any errors, but there are none. I've also verified that the search API endpoint is functioning correctly by testing it independently.

**Question:**

Can someone help me identify the issue with my search functionality? Is there something wrong with my HTML code or is there another factor at play? Any guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated."
79130529,Adding a new package broke my Spring Boot Application,"I'm getting troubles since I have added a new package in my spring boot application containing Mapstructs' mappers. Looks like the field:
@Autowired    
private UtenteMapper utenteMapper; 

is not being populated in my Service component. The Spring boot main class, PaniECumpanagghiuApplicationConfiguration, is quite essential, (it contains only the @SpringBootApplicationAnnotation annotation), but I've tried previously to add a @ComponentScan.
@SpringBootApplication    
@ComponentScan(""PaniECumpanagghiu.PaniECumpanagghiu.Mappers"")

In this way the functionality is being recovered, but the @Controller is not fired (when I invoke my API the server retrieves 404). I tried also to add all the packages into the annotation @ComponentScan, like this
@ComponentScan(""PaniECumpanagghiu.PaniECumpanagghiu.Mappers"",""PaniECumpanagghiu.PaniECumpanagghiu.controller"",...)
In this way neither the former object, UtenteMapper, is populated anymore (same behavior than the case without @ComponentScan annotation).
If I comment all references to the new package, and I simplify the API in order to return only a String (""Ciao""), the controller is fired. This is my tree directory

I have described everything in the previous section.
EDIT 1
Hey guys i have the impression that the problem is in the mapstruct dependence importing.
So I decided to give you the whole pom.

79130391,ShadCN UI and Radix UI Conflict in Vercel Commerce Template After Next.js 15 Update,"I'm facing an issue using ShadCN UI with the Vercel Commerce template after it was updated to Next.js 15. ShadCN UI components worked without issues in the previous version, but now they throw a module resolution error related to Radix UI when imported
Here’s the error I get when I try to use ShadCN UI’s DropdownMenu component:
Module not found: Can't resolve '@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu'
Steps to Reproduce
Clone the latest Vercel Commerce template (Next.js 15).
Install ShadCN UI following the official documentation.
Import and try to use any ShadCN UI component, such as DropdownMenu.
The error appears, preventing the app from compiling.
What I’ve Tried
Removing node_modules and pnpm-lock.yaml, then reinstalling dependencies.
Testing ShadCN UI with a simple Next.js 15 project (without Vercel Commerce); it works fine.
Adding @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu directly to package.json, but it didn’t resolve the issue.
Environment

Next.js Version: 15.0.0-rc.1
Package Manager: pnpm
Vercel Commerce Template: Latest version after Next.js 15 update

Expected Behavior
ShadCN UI should work as expected with the Vercel Commerce template, just like it did with the previous version of Next.js
Question
Is this a known compatibility issue between Radix UI in ShadCN and Vercel Commerce’s dependency versions? If so, are there any workarounds, or will I need to modify dependencies manually to get these components working together?
Additional Info
I’ve noticed that Radix UI components are deeply embedded in ShadCN, which may be causing version conflicts in the Vercel Commerce template. Any guidance on resolving this conflict would be helpful

The screenshot shows the problem, but I'll provide a detailed description of the issue and the relevant code.

**Issue Description:**

When I try to customize the checkout process, I encounter an error that prevents me from saving the changes. The error message is not displayed in the screenshot, but it's related to the schema discovery summary. I've tried debugging the issue, but I couldn't identify the root cause.

**Relevant Code:**

Here's the relevant code snippet that handles the checkout customization:
```javascript
// checkout-customizations /Users/jonathantuzman/dev/butcherbox/checkout-customizations
import { SchemaDiscoverySummary } from '@butcherbox/checkout-customizations';

});

// ...

schemaDiscoverySummary.saveChanges().then(() => {
  console.log('Changes saved successfully!');
}).catch((error) => {
  console.error('Error saving changes:', error);
});
```
**Expected Behavior:**

I expect the checkout customization feature to work as follows:

1. The user selects the desired customization options.
2. The application saves the changes to the schema discovery summary.
3. The user is redirected to the checkout page with the updated customization options.

**Actual Behavior:**

Instead of the expected behavior, I encounter an error when trying to save the changes. The error message is not displayed in the screenshot, but it's related to the schema discovery summary.

**Additional Information:**

* I've checked the console logs and network requests, but I couldn't find any clues about the error.
* I've tried debugging the issue using the Chrome DevTools, but I couldn't identify the root cause.
* I've searched for similar issues on Stack Overflow and GitHub, but I couldn't find any relevant solutions.

}

After the initial render, the screen displays the number 0,then I set a chrome devtool debugger in the callback of the useLayoutEffect hook before I click the div. After click, the function execution is paused at debugger, but I see the screen already shown number 1.
The docs said that useLayoutEffect fires before the browser repaints the screen，but I don't understand why the screen has updated.

",['https://i.sstatic.net/lGZ044A9.png'],** Unexpected Layout Issue with Compa UpdateEffectCallback in React Application,"I'm experiencing an issue with my code where the `useEffect` hook is not updating the state as expected. The screenshot shows the error message, but I'll provide a detailed description of the problem and the relevant code.

**Expected Behavior:**

When the user clicks the ""Update Effect"" button, the `useEffect` hook should update the `count` state variable and log the new value to the console.

**Actual Behavior:**

Instead of updating the `count` state variable, the `useEffect` hook is logging the initial value of `count` (0) to the console, even after the user clicks the ""Update Effect"" button.

**Relevant Code:**

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function CompA() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('CompA useEffectCallback');

**Additional Context:**

* I've tried using the `useCallback` hook to memoize the `handleClick` function, but it didn't resolve the issue.
* I've also tried using the `useRef` hook to store the `count` value and update it manually, but it didn't work as expected.

**Question:**

Why is the `useEffect` hook not updating the `count` state variable as expected? Is there a bug in my code or a misunderstanding of how the `useEffect` hook works?"
79126371,Override (reintroduce) property with typescript declaration merging,"The base/built-in declaration of Event and GlobalEventHandlersEventMap looks like so:
// lib.dom.d.ts

interface Event {
    /**
     * Returns the type of event, e.g. ""click"", ""hashchange"", or ""submit"".
     */
    readonly type: string;   // <-- note this part
}

interface GlobalEventHandlersEventMap {
    click: MouseEvent;
    //... all sorts of other built in events...
}

Let's say I define an EventTriggered whose constructor has a parameter containing one of the properties named in GlobalEventHandlersEventMap:
class EventTriggered {
    constructor(
        readonly eventName: keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap
    ) {}
}

This means that the following works because there is a property named 'click':
new EventTriggered('click');

But the following will not work (this is ok and intended):
new EventTriggered('some-random-string');

Now I want to use this class inside an event listener, like so:
function onClick(event: Event): void {
    new EventTriggered(event.type);
}

This will fail because as in the first example, event.type contains ""any string"". Type casting could be one way of solving this:
function onClick(event: Event): void {
    new EventTriggered(event.type as keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap);
}

BUT in my opinion, the original declaration of type is wrong - it should not be string, but keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap.
I tried doing that with declaration merging:
// global.d.ts
interface Event {
    readonly type: keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap;
}

What happens then is that the previous error still shows up, but now my IDE shows that type has two declarations:

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1.  Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
2.  Start the backend API by running `node server.js` in the terminal.
3.  Open the frontend application by running `npm start` in the terminal.
4.  Fill out the form with some sample data.
5.  Click the ""Submit"" button.

**Error Message:**

I expect the grid items to be evenly spaced and aligned properly within the container. However, as shown in the screenshot, the items are overlapping and not rendering correctly.

**Actual Behavior:**

The actual behavior is that the grid items are not being laid out correctly, resulting in overlapping and misalignment. I've tried adjusting the spacing and grid item sizes, but the issue persists.

**Additional Context:**

I've checked the Material-UI documentation and ensured that I'm using the correct props and syntax. I've also tried using different browsers and devices, but the issue remains consistent.

**Question:**

Can someone help me identify the root cause of this issue and provide a solution to fix the grid layout? I'd appreciate any guidance on how to troubleshoot this problem further."

79123414,"GitHub doesn't list latest release as ""latest""","I've set of organizational private repos with quite long lists of releases. Releases have names N-Y.M.D-X where N is sequential number, Y.M.D is date of the release and X could be commit hashcode or combination of branch name and hashcode.

The problem is the release 9-2024.10.13-607d6fd (from two weeks ago) is still marked as ""latest"" even if there are other recent releases (the actual last one - 17-2024.10.15-rename-models-1533982 - is from last week).
It looks like GitHub changed the way of latest evaluation from different day timestamps or consider the version number (9-2024 > 17-2024 lexicographically) prior the release timestamp.
Is there a way to fix that? Is it a problem of GitHub or the format of the first part of version number N-Y?
BTW: If list releases by tag then they are ordered right way.

The screenshot shows the problem, but I'll provide more context to help you understand the issue.

**Expected Behavior:**

* The application should display a list of items fetched from the API.

**Actual Behavior:**

* The application is displaying an error message instead of the list of items.
* The error message is not providing any useful information about the cause of the issue.

**Relevant Code:**

79122871,Dynamic Configuration of Facebook Login with react-native-fbsdk-next in Expo,"I am using react-native-fbsdk-next with Expo to implement Facebook login. In order to configure this, I need to include certain settings in app.config.ts, as shown in the image below:

However, I want to avoid hardcoding these values directly in the configuration file. Instead of using environment variables, I would like to fetch these configurations dynamically from an API, allowing me to update them whenever necessary. Since app.config.ts is generated only at build time, is there a way to pass these configurations dynamically?
I came across a potential solution
  const setFBSDKSecrets = async () => {
      const res: SSOType = await API('/auth/get-credentials', {
        method: 'GET',
      })

      Settings.setAppID(res.facebook.clientId)
      Settings.setClientToken(res.facebook.clientToken)
      Settings.setAppName('myApp')
      Settings.setAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled(false)
      Settings.setAutoLogAppEventsEnabled(false)
    }

    setFBSDKSecrets()

I implemented this by adding the settings there and removing them from app.config.ts. However, when I ran yarn start, I encountered an error stating that the appID is missing:
Error: missing appID in the plugin properties

Can anyone provide solution on how to resolve this issue or suggest a better approach for dynamically configuring Facebook login settings in Expo?
",['https://i.sstatic.net/G0MsWnQE.png'],"** Unhandled Exception in React Native App: ""This identifier will be used to deliver personalized ads to you"" Error","I'm experiencing an issue with my React Native app where the `react-native-fbsdk-next` library is causing a crash on Android devices. The error message is not very informative, but I've managed to capture a screenshot of the error screen (attached below).

Here's the relevant code snippet:
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import { LoginManager, AccessToken } from 'react-native-fbsdk-next';

const App = () => {
  const [accessToken, setAccessToken] = useState(null);

  const handleFacebookLogin = async () => {
    try {
      const result = await LoginManager.logInWithPermissions(['public_profile', 'email']);
      if (result.isCancelled) {
        console.log('User cancelled the login process');
      } else {
        const accessToken = await AccessToken.getCurrentAccessToken();
        setAccessToken(accessToken.accessToken);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Facebook Login Example</Text>
      <Button title=""Login with Facebook"" onPress={handleFacebookLogin} />
      {accessToken && <Text>Access Token: {accessToken}</Text>}
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```
The expected behavior is that when the user clicks the ""Login with Facebook"" button, the app should redirect to the Facebook login page, and after successful authentication, it should return to the app with an access token. However, instead of redirecting to the Facebook login page, the app crashes with the error message shown in the screenshot.

I've tried debugging the issue by adding console logs and checking the Facebook SDK documentation, but I couldn't find any clues about what might be causing the crash. I've also tried updating the `react-native-fbsdk-next` library to the latest version, but the issue persists.

Has anyone else encountered a similar issue? Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated."

",['https://i.sstatic.net/mL0Y4C0D.png'],,"I'm experiencing an issue with my project where the UI is not rendering as expected. The screenshot shows the problem, but I'll provide more context to help you understand the issue.

**Relevant Code:**

I'm using React Native with Expo for this project. Here's the relevant code snippet:
```jsx

**Expected Behavior:**

I expect the UI to render a simple ""Hello World!"" text on the screen.

**Actual Behavior:**

Instead, the screenshot shows a blank screen with no text rendered. I've tried debugging by adding console logs and checking the component tree, but I couldn't find any issues.

**Additional Context:**

* I'm using Expo SDK 41.0.0 and React Native 0.64.2.
* I've tried running the app on both Android and iOS simulators, and the issue persists on both platforms.
* I've also tried cleaning and rebuilding the project, but that didn't resolve the issue.

**What I've Tried:**

* I've checked the component tree to ensure that `MyComponent` is being rendered correctly.
* I've added console logs to verify that the component is being mounted and updated correctly.
* I've tried using a different font family or style to rule out any font-related issues.

79121996,VIM snippet (UltiSnips): pad line until column 80 reached with a character,"The code I often work at has a comment style like
#---------------------------------------------
# this is a comment
#---------------------------------------------
this.is_code()

I wanted to write a VIM snippet (using UltiSnips) that pads the comment box up until column number 80 (or better until vims colorcolumn). It should take the indentation level into account and always fill the dashes up until column 80.
I have a working snippet present that looks like this
snippet #
#`!p snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
# $1
#`!p snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
$0
endsnippet

Problem here is that when I start typing the number of dashes moves back. Because while I enter a comment the cursor I use in the snipept moves.
I think I need a pyhton or VIM variable that holdes the lines column from which I can subtract 80. But I can't find anything that works for this case.
Edit:
I've found one possible solution to avoid the moving dashes in the template by checking snip.c By checking for emptyness I can make sure that interpolation is done only once.
snippet #
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
# $1
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
$0
endsnippet

Unfortunately since I still have not found a replacement for using the current cursor position vim.current.window.cursor I get wrong lengths for snippets that have comments in indented blocks. For example:
snippet if
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
# if comment
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
IF( $1 )
   #`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
   # inside if
   #`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
   $0
   #`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
END IF

",['https://i.sstatic.net/pTOsQMfg.png'],"Unhandled Exception: ""Cannot read property 'length' of undefined"" in JavaScript Function","I'm experiencing an issue with my code where the `useEffect` hook is not updating the state as expected. The screenshot shows the problem, but I'll provide a detailed description of the issue and the relevant code.

**Issue Description:**

When I update the `data` state using the `setData` function, the `useEffect` hook is not triggered again to fetch new data from the API. Instead, it seems to be stuck with the initial data fetched during the first render.

**Relevant Code:**

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (

      {data.map(item => (
        <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**

I expect the `useEffect` hook to be triggered again whenever the `data` state changes, so that it fetches new data from the API and updates the state accordingly.

**Actual Behavior:**

The `useEffect` hook is only triggered once during the initial render, and subsequent updates to the `data` state do not trigger it again. The component remains stuck with the initial data fetched during the first render.

**Additional Context:**

I've tried adding the `data` state as a dependency to the `useEffect` hook, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. I've also checked the API endpoint and it's returning the correct data.

**Question:**

What could be causing the `useEffect` hook to not update the state as expected? Is there something wrong with my code or is this a known issue with React?"

Mx issue is I want  AccessibilityIdentifers for descriptionLabel,titleLabel,requestButton and hintLabel(For Automation) and accessibility labels for descriptionView and requestButton(VoiceOver Accessibility).
But I am unable to see accessibilityIdentifier for Button, TitleLabel and descriptionLabel in AccessibilityInspector. what am I doing wrong here?
PS: I also followed below video :

This is a working solution
 dataDisclosureView.accessibilityElements = [dataDisclosureView as Any,

                                           hintLabel as Any]
        if #available(iOS 17.0, *) {
            dataDisclosureView.automationElements =  [titleLabel as Any,

        } else {
            // Fallback on earlier versions
        }

but I am not satisfied with that because in one of Apple WWDC video it was mentioned that if we want exempt item from voice over accessibility don't add it in accessibilityItems and if we want in automation elements just add it. They haven't provided deeper details . Reference is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAqzXI3kFCk also adding screenshot about what I am saying
According to this it should be
dataDisclosureView.accessibilityElements = [dataDisclosureView as Any,

The screenshot shows the problem, but I'll provide more context to help you understand the issue.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

```swift
import UIKit

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
    }

        // Additional layout adjustments
    }
}
```

In the `viewDidLoad()` method, I've added some additional setup code to configure the view controller's layout. However, when I run the app, the layout doesn't match what I expect.

Expected Behavior:
The view controller should display a table view with a list of items, and the table view should take up the entire screen.

Actual Behavior:
The table view is not visible, and the screen is blank. I've tried debugging the issue by adding print statements and using the Xcode debugger, but I haven't been able to identify the cause of the problem.

I've also tried adjusting the layout constraints and frame sizes of the table view, but nothing seems to work. I'm stumped and could use some help figuring out what's going on.

Has anyone else encountered this issue before? Any suggestions or guidance would be greatly appreciated."

The generated swagger entry point looks like this now:

Where all the inner classes of my main class are represented by strings. If we just take a look at the first Property (IDFactura), this is the code generated by wsdltophp
     /**
     * The IDFactura
     * @var \App\Application\ServiceReferences\Verifactu\StructType\IDFacturaExpedidaType|null
     * @OA\Property()
     */
    protected ?\App\Application\ServiceReferences\Verifactu\StructType\IDFacturaExpedidaType $IDFactura = null;

(The @OA\Schema is also generated by wsdltophp) But it's clear that my SwaggerUI is representing this inner class like a simple string.
Since this WSDL is external and I have no control over it, nor the wsdltophp generated code, I'm looking for a solution which would avoid updating/modifying those external classes

79119961,Chrome Extension: Refused to load script due to Content Security Policy (CSP) after no recent changes,"I've been working on a Chrome extension using Vite and React, and everything was working fine until recently. I haven't made any changes, but now I’m getting a Content Security Policy (CSP) error preventing a script from loading.
Here is the error message I'm getting in the console:
Refused to load the script 'chrome-extension://5216f022-cd78-49fc-abf9-9e362fc1640f/assets/content-script-preamble.js.js' 
because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: 
""script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval' 'inline-speculation-rules' http://localhost:* http://127.0.0.1:*"". 
Note that 'script-src-elem' was not explicitly set, so 'script-src' is used as a fallback.


Here is my manifest.json:
{
  ""manifest_version"": 3,
  ""name"": ""CRXJS React Vite Example"",
  ""version"": ""1.0.0"",
  ""action"": { ""default_title"": ""Tags New"", ""default_popup"": ""index.html"" },

    ""48"": ""images/icon64.png"",

The error message seems to indicate that the script chrome-extension://5216f022-cd78-49fc-abf9-9e362fc1640f/assets/content-script-preamble.js.js is being blocked due to a violation of the CSP. However, I haven’t made any changes to the manifest or the code recently.
Some additional context:

The extension uses Vite and React.
The error started appearing suddenly, and the extension was working fine previously.
I am not explicitly loading any external scripts apart from the ones within the extension.
My CSP currently allows 'self' and 'wasm-unsafe-eval' under script-src.
I've tried to debug this but can’t seem to pinpoint what might be causing this issue.

My questions:

What might be the cause of this error if nothing has changed in my extension?
How can I resolve the CSP issue to allow the script to load properly?
Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

The screenshot shows the problem, but I'll provide a detailed description of the issue and the relevant code.

**Issue Description:**

The layout is supposed to display a list of items with images and text, but instead, it's showing a blank space where the images should be. The text is displayed correctly, but the images are not visible.

**Relevant Code:**

I'm using React Native to build the app, and I've created a custom component for the list item. Here's the code for the component:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, Image, Text } from 'react-native';

const ListItem = ({ item }) => {
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, flexDirection: 'row' }}>
      <Image source={{ uri: item.image }} style={{ width: 50, height: 50 }} />
      <Text style={{ fontSize: 18, color: '#333' }}>{item.text}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default ListItem;
```
I'm using the `Image` component from `react-native` to display the image, and I've set the `source` prop to the `uri` of the image. I've also set the `style` prop to define the width and height of the image.

**Expected Behavior:**

I expect the images to be displayed next to the text in the list item. The images should be visible and should not be blank.

**Actual Behavior:**

The images are not visible, and instead, a blank space is displayed where the images should be. The text is displayed correctly, but the images are not rendered.

**Additional Information:**

I've checked the console logs, and there are no errors or warnings related to the image rendering. I've also tried using a different image source, but the issue persists.

I've tried searching for similar issues on Stack Overflow, but I couldn't find any solutions that work for my case. I would appreciate any help or guidance on how to resolve this issue."

The screenshot shows the problem, but I'll provide more context to help you understand the issue.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

```html

In this code, I'm using a custom directive called 'srcFile' to bind the image URL to the 'src' attribute of the 'img' element. However, when I inspect the element in the browser, the 'src' attribute is empty.

Expected behavior:

* The 'src' attribute should be populated with the correct image URL.
* The image should be displayed in the browser.

Actual behavior:

* The 'src' attribute is empty.
* The image is not displayed in the browser.

I've tried debugging the issue by checking the value of the 'srcFile' variable, but it seems to be correct. I've also checked the network requests, and the image is being fetched correctly.

I'm using Vue.js as my front-end framework, and I've defined the 'srcFile' directive as follows:

```javascript
Vue.directive('srcFile', {
  bind(el, binding) {
    el.src = binding.value;

})
```

I've also tried using the 'v-bind' shorthand to bind the 'src' attribute directly, but the issue persists:

**IDE Context:**

I'm using Visual Studio Code with the following extensions installed:

* HTML/CSS/JS Extension Pack
* Live Server

**Expected Behavior:**

I expect the two columns to be evenly spaced and take up the full width of the container.

**Actual Behavior:**

The screenshot shows that the columns are not evenly spaced, and there is a gap between them. The right column is also not taking up the full width of the container.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Create a new HTML file and add the above code.
2. Open the file in Visual Studio Code.
3. Start the Live Server extension.
4. Open the browser and navigate to the URL provided by the Live Server.

The built-in Search icon is misaligned (see screenshot below). It was ok before.

The screenshot also shows the automatic kendo-popup tag in the Browser Developer tools, seen when a user clicks in Choose Document Type dropdown. As this popup is very dynamic, I can't inspect further the Search icon in Developer Tools to see the automatic Kendo HTML tags and CSS classes so that I can potentially override a CSS class related to the icon.
How can I align the Search icon properly (to be at the beginning of the input field and vertically seen fully)?

79089650,Laravel Broadcasting not firing on the Job Queue,"I am creating a AI ChatBot. The message is entered on the frontend (Livewire) and then stored in the database. A model ""created"" listener then pushes a job onto the queue which asks the AI (LLM) the prompt and the answer is then updated on the model (on the queue). There is then an ""updated"" listener, which fires a broadcasting event.
On the front end the Livewire component is listening via Laravel Echo for the updated event, and the chat response is shown to the user.
The problem I have is that the broadcasting event works, but not on the queue. I have tested it via a Console Command and it updates the chat, but when the job is processed on the queue, no update occurs.
I have checked the Herd logs, and again, I can see the event broadcasting when I manually trigger with the Console Command, but no event is broadcasted when the job is processed on the queue.
So:

The job to get the llm response is always successfully processed on the queue when the model is created
The LlmMessage model is always updated successfully by this job, and the response is stored
The LlmMessageUpdated event is broadcasted and the Livewire Component updated when a manual update is triggered
The LlmMessageUpdated event is not broadcasted and the Livewire Component is not updated when the job updates the model

**Expected Behavior**

I expect the program to print numbers from 0 to 9, one number per second, and then exit cleanly.

**Actual Behavior**

Instead, the program hangs indefinitely after printing the first number (0). The error message in the screenshot indicates that there is an issue with the channel subscription.

**Additional Information**

* Operating System: macOS Catalina
* IDE: Visual Studio Code

I have tried debugging the issue by adding print statements and using the Go debugger, but I am unable to identify the root cause of the problem. Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated."

  'write.format.default' = 'orc',

Then I noticed that an extra sort step was added when writing out the data into this table in spark job.
This increased the time it took to write out the data.
So I tried to set write.distribution-mode to none like the one below.
ALTER TABLE prod.db.sample SET TBLPROPERTIES (
    'write.distribution-mode'='none'
);

Moreover, it appears from the latest metadata file on hdfs that this setting was successful.

But when I re-ran the job, there was still an extra sort step.
How can I set write.distribution-mode to none in this situation without changing the version of spark&iceberg?

The screenshot shows the problem, but I'll provide more context to help you understand the issue.

**Relevant Code:**

I'm using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build my project. Here's the relevant code snippet:
```html
<div class=""container"">
  <div class=""row"">
    <div class=""col-md-6"">

**Expected Behavior:**

I expect the layout to render with two columns side by side, each taking up 50% of the container's width. The dynamic content should be added to each column without affecting the layout.

**Actual Behavior:**

However, as shown in the screenshot, the layout is not rendering as expected. The columns are not taking up the correct width, and the dynamic content is causing the layout to break. I've tried adjusting the CSS and JavaScript code, but I'm unable to resolve the issue.

**Additional Context:**

* I'm using a responsive design framework (e.g., Bootstrap) to handle the layout.
* The dynamic content is being added to each column using JavaScript.
* I've checked the browser console for any errors, but there are none.

I can see that the 'members' table was created using MySQL Workbench, but no matter how many times I refresh or rerun the code, the 'members' table doesn't contain data like Tony and others.

    try:

        conn_test.commit()
    except Exception as e:
        conn_test.rollback()

        print(e);

As you can see, this piece of code doesn’t seem to show any errors, because if there were compilation errors, the 'try' and 'except' should have caught them, but they didn’t.
At the same time, the SQL database still doesn’t have any data like Tony and others.
Since I’m new to this, I’m feeling a bit lost. I really hope I can resolve this issue. In addition to continuing my research, I sincerely ask for your help. Thank you guys.

# Game loop

    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()

    pygame.display.flip()

    # Cap the frame rate

The expected behavior is that the window should display the text ""Hello, World!"" in black font on a white background. However, the actual behavior is that the window displays a distorted and pixelated image of a yellow emoji character.

The expected behavior is that the `dSessionCommand.cs` file should be compiled successfully, and the `EraSendSessionCommand` class should be recognized by the compiler. However, the actual behavior is that the compiler throws an error stating that the file is not found.

I've tried checking the file path and ensuring that it's correctly referenced in the project, but the issue persists. I've also tried cleaning and rebuilding the project, but that hasn't resolved the issue either.

In this code, I've added the `autofocus` attribute to the `username` input field, expecting it to receive focus automatically when the page loads. However, the screenshot shows that the focus is not being set to the `username` field.

I've tried different approaches to resolve this issue, including:

*   Using the `autofocus` attribute on the `password` input field instead
*   Adding a JavaScript event listener to set focus on the `username` field on page load
*   Using a different browser to test the functionality

Despite these efforts, the issue persists. I've also checked the browser console for any errors, but none are reported.

The expected behavior is for the `username` input field to receive focus automatically when the page loads, allowing the user to start typing their username without having to click on the field. However, the actual behavior is that the focus is not being set to the `username` field, requiring the user to manually click on the field to start typing.

I would appreciate any guidance on how to resolve this issue and achieve the expected behavior. Thank you for your help."

79079676,Fullcalendar Angular. How is the eventContent Angular template actually rendered in FullCalendar?,"Fullcalendar supports an eventContent and numerous other callbacks letting us to define custom templates for event UI and etc...
There is a wrapper library called @fullcalendar/angular, it provides a way to define custom event template in angular style and it renders into the correct spot the calendar.

  <ng-template #eventContent let-arg>
    I am an event with {{ binding }} and {{ arg.event.title }}
  </ng-template>
</full-calendar>

My question: How actually this library makes it work? Fullcalendar in a nutshell is just a javascript library and I expect there is somewhere eventContent callback is called and this library does a trick by taking the template and creating a DOM element out of it. Can you tell me what technique is used for that? I can rephrase a question: how to dynamically generate a DOM Element, a template of which is managed by Angular. I even fine if change detection will not work automatically (it probably won't).
I pulled a source repo and it's content is very strange to me. I see how the eventContent is read from @contentChildren but nothing happens with it after.

If I comment out the line renderer: new SVGRenderer() in this config, everything works perfectly!
The error itself looks like this:

",['https://i.sstatic.net/GPGUHO9Q.png'],Uncaught runtime error: Maximum call stack size exceeded in recursive function call,"I'm experiencing an issue with my code where I'm encountering a ""Maximum call stack size exceeded"" error. The error occurs when I try to execute a specific function, and I've narrowed it down to a particular line of code.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

```javascript
function myFunction() {
  // ...
  myFunction(); // This line causes the error
}
```

The expected behavior is that the function should execute without any errors and return the expected result. However, the actual behavior is that the function calls itself recursively without terminating, leading to a stack overflow error.

I've tried debugging the issue by adding console logs and using the debugger, but I'm still unable to identify the root cause of the problem. I've also searched online for similar issues, but none of the solutions seem to apply to my specific case.

I'm using Node.js version 14.17.0 and the latest version of the `my-library` library. I've also tried updating my dependencies and reinstalling the library, but the issue persists.

Here's a screenshot of the error message:

",['https://i.sstatic.net/MnLRVDpB.png'],"** Unhandled Exception in ASP.NET MVC Application: ""An error occurred while processing your request.""","I'm experiencing an issue with my code where the `init` method is not being called as expected. The screenshot shows the error message I'm receiving, but I'll provide more context to help you understand the problem.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, id, name):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name

    def init(self, id, name):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
```

In this code, I have a class `MyClass` with an `__init__` method that initializes the object's attributes. However, I also have a separate `init` method that seems to be causing the issue.

The expected behavior is that when I create an instance of `MyClass`, the `__init__` method should be called automatically, and the `init` method should not be called at all. However, the actual behavior is that the `init` method is being called instead of the `__init__` method, resulting in the error message shown in the screenshot.

I've tried debugging the code, but I'm not sure why the `init` method is being called instead of the `__init__` method. I've checked the documentation and searched online, but I couldn't find any information that explains this behavior.

Can someone please help me understand what's going on and how to fix this issue? I'd appreciate any guidance or insights you can provide.

**Additional Information:**

* I'm using Python 3.8.5 as my programming language.
* I'm running the code in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
* I've tried restarting the kernel and re-running the code, but the issue persists.

        self.name = name

    def init(self, id, name):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
```

**Expected Output:**

When I create an instance of `MyClass`, I expect the `__init__` method to be called automatically, and the `init` method should not be called at all.

**Actual Output:**

The `init` method is being called instead of the `__init__` method, resulting in the error message shown in the screenshot."
79050210,Azure DevOps. Can't trigger a pipeline in Repo A when a commit is done in repo B,"I’m using Version Dev17.M153.5 (TFS), and I have two repositories: my source code is hosted in Repo B, and my pipelines are hosted in Repo A to keep responsibilities separated.
My goal is for the pipeline in Repo A to automatically run whenever a commit is pushed to Repo B. Below is my current setup:
# MY MAIN PIPELINE IN REPO A:
trigger: none
resources:
  repositories:
    - repository: RepoB
      type: git
      name: Project/RepoB
      ref: develop
      trigger:
        branches:
          include:
            - develop
            - master

pool:
  name: 'Test'

variables:
  REPO_URL: 'https://tfs.company.com/company/Project/_git/RepoB'

steps:
  - task: PowerShell@2
    displayName: 'Configurar encabezado GIT_AUTH_HEADER con PAT'
    inputs:
      targetType: 'inline'
      script: |
        # Crear el encabezado de autenticación en formato Base64
        $headerValue = ""Authorization: Basic "" + [Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes("":"" + $env:PAT))

        git -c http.extraheader=""$headerValue"" clone $(REPO_URL)
    env:
      PAT: $(PAT)  # El PAT como variable de entorno secreta

    #Templates
  - ${{ if eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/master') }}:
    - template: pipeline-master.yml

  - ${{ if eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/develop') }}:
    - template: pipeline-develop.yml

The Issue:
This pipeline does not trigger automatically when a commit is pushed to Repo B on either develop or master. I cannot use checkout because it only accepts self or none. However, Repo B is successfully cloned, and the pipeline runs fine if I trigger it manually
Additional Considerations:

Build services have ""Read and Contribute"" permissions set to ""Allow"" in both repositories.
Both Repo A and Repo B are part of the same project.
The Personal Access Token (PAT) is correctly configured, and the pipeline passes when executed manually.


Question:
Why is the pipeline not triggering automatically, and how can I ensure it runs whenever a commit is pushed to Repo B?
Update
I have read many posts warning about compiling the YAML file in the default branch. I am compiling it in master, which is my default branch, and still doesn't work
Many thanks in advance!

When I researched this problem, the solution says if you are using a nullable command you need to use a length like this: @Column(nullable = false, length = 4096) and this does not solve my problem.
Wrong but If I can't solve I'm gonna add a Soft Delete endpoint with PUT annotation and just update is_deleted part to true.
Thank you for your help!
Edit: When I delete these lines problem is solved but delete is not soft anymore:
@SQLDelete(sql = ""UPDATE permission SET is_deleted = true WHERE id=?"")
@Where(clause = ""is_deleted=false"")

The expected behavior is that the circle should be fully visible within the white box, but instead, it's being cut off at the bottom.

Here's a screenshot of the issue:

[Insert Screenshot]

I've tried adjusting the height and width of the white box, as well as the position of the green circle, but nothing seems to be working. I've also checked the CSS styles and HTML structure, but I'm not seeing any obvious issues.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

```html
<div class=""white-box"">
  <div class=""green-circle""></div>
</div>
```

```css
.white-box {
  width: 150px;
  height: 150px;

  border: 1px solid #ddd;

  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

I've also tried using different browsers and devices, but the issue persists. I'm stumped and would appreciate any help in resolving this issue.

**Expected Behavior:**

* The green circle should be fully visible within the white box.
* The circle should be centered both horizontally and vertically within the box.

**Actual Behavior:**

* The green circle is being cut off at the bottom of the white box.
* The circle is not centered vertically within the box.

",['https://i.sstatic.net/9XAvvDKN.png'],"Azure AD B2C Custom Policy Error: ""Successfully fetched the user"" Message with Missing User Data","I'm experiencing an issue with my project where the user interface is not rendering as expected. The screenshot shows the problem, but I'll provide more context to help you understand the issue.

**Relevant Code:**

I'm using React and Redux to manage the state of my application. The component that's causing the issue is a custom `UserCard` component, which is rendered inside a `UserList` component. Here's the relevant code:

```jsx
// UserCard.js
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

const UserCard = () => {
  const user = useSelector((state) => state.user);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{user.name}</h2>
      <p>{user.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default UserCard;
```

```jsx
// UserList.js
import React from 'react';
import UserCard from './UserCard';

const UserList = () => {
  const users = useSelector((state) => state.users);

  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map((user) => (
        <li key={user.id}>
          <UserCard user={user} />
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

export default UserList;
```

**Expected Behavior:**

I expect the `UserCard` component to render the user's name and email address correctly. However, as shown in the screenshot, the email address is not being rendered at all.

**Actual Behavior:**

The email address is not being rendered, and instead, I see a strange symbol (``) in its place. I've tried debugging the issue by logging the `user` object in the `UserCard` component, and it appears to have the correct data. However, when I try to access the `email` property, it returns `undefined`.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Create a new React project using `create-react-app`.
2. Install `react-redux` and `redux` using npm or yarn.
3. Create a new file called `UserCard.js` and add the code above.
4. Create a new file called `UserList.js` and add the code above.
5. Create a new file called `index.js` and add the following code:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './store';
import UserList from './UserList';

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <UserList />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
6. Run the application using `npm start`.

**Environment:**

Actual behavior: The side margins are still present, and the content is not taking up the full width of the container.

I expect the RecyclerView to display the items in a horizontal list, with each item taking up an equal amount of space. The items should be evenly spaced and aligned to the left.

**Actual Behavior:**

However, as shown in the screenshot, the RecyclerView is displaying the items in a vertical list, with each item taking up the full width of the screen. The items are not evenly spaced and are not aligned to the left.

**Additional Information:**

* I've tried setting the RecyclerView's layout manager to a GridLayoutManager, but it doesn't change the behavior.
* I've also tried setting the adapter's layout resource to a different layout file, but it doesn't affect the issue.
* I'm using Android Studio 3.5.3 and the latest version of the RecyclerView library.

**Question:**

What could be causing the RecyclerView to display the items in a vertical list instead of a horizontal list? Is there a specific setting or configuration that I'm missing? Any help would be appreciated."

And the app-three-js-interactive component:
<canvas #canvas></canvas>

I have spent roughly 5 hours now, trying to figure out why the app-three-js-interactive is not created, and my HTML inspector just looks like this with absolutely nothing inside the component. No constructor call, no ngInit, no ngAfterViewInit, nothing...

Even after removing all the code from the component it still does not instantiate anything

@Component({
  selector: 'app-three-js-interactive',
  templateUrl: './three-js-interactive.component.html'
})

    console.log(""help!"")
  }

The module is declared in the app.module.ts and I've done everything I can think of to get it working but I am completely out of ideas, if I make a new component it works just fine, but this one component just does not want to be created in the place I am trying. It does work in a different location which is puzzling me even more... Does anyone have any idea why this is happening, or any other info you need to help me figure out what is going on...

The screenshot shows the problem, but I'll provide more context to help you understand the issue.

**Code Context:**

I'm using React 17.0.2 and Three.js 0.132.2. Here's the relevant code snippet:
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import * as THREE from 'three';

const App = () => {
  const [scene, setScene] = useState(null);
  const [camera, setCamera] = useState(null);
  const [renderer, setRenderer] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const init = async () => {
      const scene = new THREE.Scene();
      const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
      const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({
        canvas: document.getElementById('canvas'),
        antialias: true
      });

      // ... other scene setup code ...

      setScene(scene);
      setCamera(camera);
      setRenderer(renderer);
    };

    init();
  }, []);

        <app-three-js-interactive scene={scene} camera={camera} renderer={renderer} />
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
**Expected Behavior:**

The `app-three-js-interactive` component should render a 3D scene with a rotating cube. The cube should be visible and interactive.

**Actual Behavior:**

The `app-three-js-interactive` component is not rendering the 3D scene. Instead, it displays a blank canvas with no cube visible. The console does not show any errors.

**Additional Information:**

* I've checked the Three.js documentation and ensured that I'm using the correct version and importing the necessary modules.
* I've also verified that the `scene`, `camera`, and `renderer` objects are being created and passed to the `app-three-js-interactive` component correctly.
* I've tried debugging the issue by adding console logs and inspecting the DOM, but I couldn't find any clues about what's causing the problem.

If someone could help me identify the issue and provide a solution, I would greatly appreciate it."

However, when I include <cstdlib>, I do not have std::getenv_s, only getenv_s (global namespace).
cppreference has the following note:

As with all bounds-checked functions, getenv_s is only guaranteed to be available if __STDC_LIB_EXT1__ is defined by the implementation and if the user defines __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ to the integer constant 1 before including <stdlib.h>.

Even when I define __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ as 1, My compiler (MSVC C++23) does not find the std::getenv_s function.

```

I've tried searching for solutions online, but none of them seem to work. I've also checked the documentation for `std::getenv`, and it doesn't mention anything about `getenv_s`.

Expected behavior:

* The program should compile and run without errors.
* The program should print the value of the APPDATA environment variable to the console.

Actual behavior:

* The program fails to compile due to the ""std"" has no member ""getenv_s"" error.

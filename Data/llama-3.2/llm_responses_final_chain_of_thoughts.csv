Users.Take( 5 ).Dump();

The results pane has properties in order they were defined in the .dbml file, and thus in the order they were placed in the generated C# class.
In LINQPad 8 with EF Core DbContext objects, if I dump out the same table, the properties are always dumped in alphabetical order vs the order of property declaration in the scaffolded class.
Is there a way to make it dump based on order of declaration?
I saw post about Change order of dump properties which I could maybe implement, but would rather just get a default behavior of order properties appear in class.

  useCallback,
  type ComponentPropsWithRef,
  type ElementType,
  type JSX,
  type JSXElementConstructor,
  type Ref,
} from 'react';

type IntrinsicAttributes<

    console.log(ev.currentTarget);
  }, []);

  return <Element ref={ref} onClick={handleOnClick} {...restProps} />;
}) as <E extends ElementType = 'div'>(props: BoxProps<E>) => JSX.Element;

For the handleOnClick callback, I assigned the event in the callback the HTMLElement type from @types/react-dom because it is the parent of all possible HTML dom elements and was generic enough to satisfy TypeScript.
But, I now specifically need access to the event.currentTarget property.

The only way I know of to make TypeScript aware of the currentTarget property is to change HTMLElement to a more specific type, like HTMLButtonElement. But that breaks polymorphism because the developer could pick a tag like ""a"" which means I would need to change the callback event type to HTMLAnchorElement
Is there a generic React Typescript type for HTMLElement that accepts a tag string?  Like HTMLElement<'button'>. I'm just not aware of a generic type that can allow me to set the event conditionally based on an HTML tag name.
",['https://i.sstatic.net/19LCKEF3.png'],"Error in HTML Element Reference: ""Property 'currentTarget' does not exist on type 'HTMLElement'.""","I'm experiencing an issue with my code in the screenshot provided. The IDE being used is Visual Studio Code, and the code appears to be written in JavaScript. There are no error messages or unusual indicators visible in the screenshot.

The main issue seems to be related to the `handleOnClick` function, which is not defined anywhere in the code. The function is called when a button is clicked, but it does not exist on the `HTMLElement` type. This suggests that there might be a configuration or syntax issue.

To understand this issue better, it's important to note that the code is using the `HTMLElement` type, which is a part of the HTML DOM. The `handleOnClick` function is likely intended to handle the click event of an HTML element, but it's not defined anywhere in the code.

One possible solution to this issue would be to define the `handleOnClick` function and ensure that it's properly bound to the HTML element. This could involve adding an event listener to the element and defining the function within the scope of the element.

Here's an example of how the `handleOnClick` function could be defined:

```javascript
function handleOnClick(event) {
  // Handle the click event here
  console.log('Button clicked!');
}
```

In addition to defining the function, it's also important to ensure that it's properly bound to the HTML element. This could involve using the `addEventListener` method to attach the function to the element's click event.

```javascript
const button = document.getElementById('myButton');
button.addEventListener('click', handleOnClick);
```

Overall, the issue appears to be related to the definition and binding of the `handleOnClick` function. By defining the function and ensuring that it's properly bound to the HTML element, it should be possible to resolve the issue and get the code working as intended."

function createServer<typeof http.IncomingMessage, typeof http.ServerResponse>(requestListener?: http.RequestListener<typeof http.IncomingMessage, typeof http.ServerResponse>): http.Server<typeof http.IncomingMessage, typeof http.ServerResponse> (+1 overload)


This verbose suggestion makes it difficult to read the method’s basic structure.
I would like IntelliSense to show a simplified version, such as:
function createServer(requestListener?: (request: IncomingMessage, response: ServerResponse) => void): Server

I've already tried configuring ""typescript.inlayHints"" settings and adding a jsconfig.json file to simplify IntelliSense, but it hasn't had the desired effect.
Question: Is there a way to adjust VS Code settings or install specific plugins to reduce IntelliSense verbosity for Node.js functions, specifically to show only essential information?

79143556,How to get accurate code coverage report using gcovr for MSYS2 MINGW64 Clang project?,"I try to use gcovr tool to obtain code coverage of a C++ project built on Windows using MSYS2 MINGW64's Clang toolchain.
I've decided to use such setup to mimic how the project is built on the CI system.
The project consists of a test executable E (it uses GoogleTest framework) and two static libraries, L1 and L2, having the following dependencies: L1 -> L2; L1, L2 -> E.
It is build using CMake system.
When building for code coverage, at the very beginning of the whole process I append to all targets the following compiler flags (CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS): -g --coverage -fPIC -O0 -fno-elide-constructors
Then, I generate code coverage report using the following command:
-- C:/msys64/mingw64/bin/gcovr.exe --html index.html --html-details -r <PROJECT_ROOT> --object-directory=<BUILD_DIR> --gcov-executable=llvm-cov gcov --merge-mode-functions=merge-use-line-min --exclude-unreachable-branches --exclude-function-lines --exclude-lines-by-pattern '^\s*\}?\s*$'
The first problem I've encountered is that for at least one source file some functions were found on multiple lines in the same file - what makes no sense to me, as e.g. gcovr reported one of such functions to start in L183 and L185, whereas it actually starts in L185 and L183 contains the closing brace of totally different function. I have no clue why I got this error, but managed to bypass it by using --merge-mode-functions=merge-use-line-min flag.
However, the resulting report is garbage. In particular, numerous empty lines as well as lines containing only comments/closing braces are marked as ""not hit"" what makes the output rather not useful.
Note that I've used --exclude-lines-by-pattern '^\s*\}?\s*$' flag, but for some reason it did not filter out the mentioned problematic lines.
Here is an excerpt from the generated report:

What should I do to make the results more accurate? Use different compiler/linker flags? A different coverage tool?
A different toolchain is not so feasible solution, as then I would have to constantly rebuild the whole project to switch between e.g. Clang <-> GCC.
I've tried to add -Xclang -fprofile-instrument=clang compiler flags to all build targets, but then the build process was stuck at linking my test executable E (or the process was slowed down, that I assumed it became staled; instead of completing let's say in 10-20 seconds, it did not finished even after a few minutes). 
[EDIT: It finished after some 15-20 minutes, with a long list of ""undefined reference"" errors occuring for GoogleTest library (libgtest.a) and related to elements of C++ standard library, e.g.:
C:/msys64/mingw64/bin/ld: lib/libgtest.a(gtest-all.cc.obj):C:/msys64/mingw64/include/c++/14.2.0/bits/stl_tree.h:1964: more undefined references to '__profc__ZNKSt8_Rb_treeINSt7__cxx1112basic_stringIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEES5_St9_IdentityIS5_ESt4lessIS5_ESaIS5_EE14_M_lower_boundEPKSt13_Rb_tree_nodeIS5_EPKSt18_Rb_tree_node_baseRKS5_' follow

However, the resulting ellipse appears distorted and not as expected.

Here's a snippet of my code:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Create a blank image
img = np.zeros((512, 512, 3), np.uint8)

# Define the center and axes of the ellipse
center = (256, 256)
axes = (100, 50)

# Draw the ellipse
cv2.ellipse(img, center, axes, 0, 0, 360, (255, 0, 0), 2)

# Display the image
cv2.imshow('Ellipse', img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

The issue is that the ellipse is not being drawn correctly, with the major axis appearing shorter than expected. I've tried adjusting the `axes` parameter, but it doesn't seem to have any effect.

I've also tried using the `cv2.ellipse` function with different parameters, such as changing the angle and start/end angles, but nothing seems to work.

I've searched through the OpenCV documentation and Stack Overflow, but I couldn't find any solutions that address this specific issue.

Can anyone help me understand what's going on and how to fix this? Is there something wrong with my code or is this a known issue with OpenCV?"

79142883,HttpContext.Current.Session returns Null in .NET Framework v4.8,"I am moving my .NET solution to a new server that uses VS2022 and .NET Framework 4.8. Originally my codebase was targetting .NET 4.5.2 (now eol) version.
So when I moved a copy of the codebase and opened the solution, VS asked for updating the codebase to .NET 4.8 and that's all updated. Once updating the codebase, session setting in web.config:
<system.web>
    <sessionState timeout=""40"" mode=""InProc""/>
    <compilation debug=""true"" targetFramework=""4.8""/>
    <httpRuntime targetFramework=""4.5""/>
</system.web>

The GetSession method has a line of code:
HttpContext.Current.Session.Contents[Parameter].ToString();

which now returns NULL and errors with

Object reference not set to an instance of an object

Code:
 public string GetSession(string Parameter)
 {
     try

     }
     catch (Exception e)

The exact same codebase works perfectly fine in the old server with .NET framework 4.5.2. Any help on how to fix this?

However, I'm encountering an error when running the code. The error message is not explicitly shown in the screenshot, but based on the context, it seems to be related to the sorting process.

The code snippet provided is incomplete, but it appears to be using the `sorted` function with a lambda function that takes two arguments, `x` and `y`. The lambda function is supposed to return a value that will be used for sorting purposes. However, the exact logic behind this lambda function is unclear without more context.

To troubleshoot this issue, I would first check the documentation for the `sorted` function and lambda functions in Python to ensure that I'm using them correctly. I would also verify that the input data is in the correct format and that there are no syntax errors in the code.

If the issue persists, I would try to simplify the code by removing the lambda function and using a simpler sorting key. I would also consider using a different sorting algorithm or data structure if the current approach is not suitable for the problem at hand.

Overall, without more information about the error message and the specific requirements of the sorting algorithm, it's difficult to provide a precise solution. However, by following these steps, I should be able to identify the root cause of the issue and find a suitable solution."

How to make Spring Boot inject employeeRepository correctly?
",['https://i.sstatic.net/fzGmlmh6.png'],"Error in TensorFlow Model Compilation: ""InvalidArgumentError: Incompatible shapes""","I'm experiencing an issue with my code in the screenshot provided. The IDE being used is IntelliJ IDEA, and the code appears to be written in Java. There are no error messages visible in the screenshot, but there is a red underline under the line `return new / / let your annotations like @RestController use @GetMapping media / /api / users`. This suggests that there might be a syntax issue or an unresolved import.

The main issue seems to be related to the annotation `@GetMapping` and how it's being used. The specific component involved is the `@RestController` annotation. Based on the context, it appears that this is a configuration issue, as the code is trying to use an annotation that might not be properly imported or configured.

To understand this issue, some background information on Spring Boot and its annotations would be helpful. The relevant framework/language versions are likely Spring Boot 2.x and Java 11. It's possible that the issue arose from a misconfiguration of the `@GetMapping` annotation or a missing import statement.

Obvious solutions that might have been tried include checking the import statements, verifying the correct usage of the `@GetMapping` annotation, and reviewing the Spring Boot documentation for any specific requirements or restrictions on using this annotation. Relevant documentation might include the official Spring Boot documentation and Stack Overflow questions related to `@GetMapping` and `@RestController`.

Troubleshooting steps that would make sense include checking the project's dependencies, verifying the correct version of Spring Boot, and searching for similar issues on Stack Overflow or other developer forums. 

Here is the code snippet from the screenshot:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping(""/api/users"")
public class UserController {
    @GetMapping(""/users"")
    public List<User> getUsers() {
        // implementation
    }
}
```

I've tried checking the import statements and verifying the correct usage of the `@GetMapping` annotation, but the issue persists. I've also reviewed the Spring Boot documentation and searched for similar issues on Stack Overflow, but couldn't find a solution. Any help or guidance would be appreciated."
79139703,How can I show an unauthorized view when HttpClient gets 403 from calling API in .NET Blazor Web Assembly?,"Basically here is my scenario that I'm going to achieve:

I have two users: A and B, A has the permission to access my Restful API developed with ASP.NET Core Web API, B doesn't have the permission to access that API resource (API will return 403)
In my Blazor Web Assembly app, there is a page which will read data from this Restful API, so, I would like when A user logs in, s/he can access this page correctly, but when B logs in, since B doesn't have the access to the API, therefore, when the page is loading and reading data from API, the page will get 403 error and should instead show something like ""You don't have permission to access the page""

So, in the OnInitializedAsync method of the Blazor page, it uses injected IHttpClientFactory to create an HttpClient, and makes a call to the API:
using var httpClient = HttpClientFactory.CreateClient(""stickersHttpClient"");
var httpResponseMessage = await httpClient.GetAsync($""api/stickers?page={pageNumber}&size={pageSize}"");
httpResponseMessage.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
var responseJson = await httpResponseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
PageContent = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<StickersPage>(responseJson);

If it is user B who opens this page, the httpClient.GetAsync will definitely return 403 error, but instead of showing a ""You don't have permission to view this page"" error on the page, the page actually reported an error in the console:

I have already applied @attribute [Authorize] on the page, and in the App.razor it has the following authorized view settings:
<CascadingAuthenticationState>
    <Router AppAssembly=""@typeof(App).Assembly"">
        <Found Context=""routeData"">
            <AuthorizeRouteView RouteData=""@routeData"" DefaultLayout=""@typeof(MainLayout)"">
                <NotAuthorized>
                    @if (context.User.Identity?.IsAuthenticated != true)
                    {
                        <RedirectToLogin />
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        <p role=""alert"">You don't have permission to view this page.</p>
                    }
                </NotAuthorized>
            </AuthorizeRouteView>
            <FocusOnNavigate RouteData=""@routeData"" Selector=""h1"" />
        </Found>
        <NotFound>
            <PageTitle>Not found</PageTitle>
            <LayoutView Layout=""@typeof(MainLayout)"">
                <p role=""alert"">Sorry, there's nothing at this address.</p>
            </LayoutView>
        </NotFound>
    </Router>
</CascadingAuthenticationState>

I think there should be some gap between the API and the page, there should be the way allowing my razor page to ""know"" about the 403 returned by the API so that it could apply the routed authentication view. But I don't know how can I do that.
(By the way, the authorization of the user is done against Keycloak with the policy based on user roles)

The IDE being used is IntelliJ IDEA, and the code appears to be written in Java. There are no error messages or unusual indicators visible in the screenshot.

The main issue seems to be related to the use of the `@main` annotation, which is not recognized by the compiler. The specific components involved are the `main` method and the `@main` annotation. This appears to be a configuration issue, as the `@main` annotation is not a standard Java annotation.

To understand this issue, it's important to note that the `@main` annotation is not a part of the Java standard library. It's possible that the annotation is part of a custom framework or library that is not properly configured in the project.

Some obvious solutions that might have been tried include checking the project's dependencies and ensuring that the correct version of the Java compiler is being used. Relevant documentation might include the Java documentation for the `@main` annotation, as well as any documentation provided by the custom framework or library.

Troubleshooting steps that would make sense include checking the project's build configuration, verifying that the correct version of the Java compiler is being used, and searching for any known issues with the `@main` annotation in the custom framework or library.

79132115,Run Roboelectric in Unit Testing and Most Efficient way to perform instrument test at physical device,"I'm doing some old codelab on testing here, But in the codelab it uses Roboelectric in UnitTest folder, but when I run that it stuck on this part

Here's the code.

    // Subject under test
    private lateinit var tasksViewModel: TasksViewModel

    // Executes each task synchronously using Architecture Components.

    fun addNewTask_setsNewTaskEvent() {

        // When adding a new task

        // Then the new task event is triggered

        assertThat(tasksViewModel.tasksAddViewVisible.getOrAwaitValue(), `is`(true))
    }

}

Well I know that the purpose of the UnitTest is to run the test faster, I on the later codelab it stated that it's faster to mock / fake the repository and pass it to the viewModel rather than using context and instantiate the viewModel (which remove the AndroidJUnit4 test runner) and remove the roboelectric test that takes ages to run.

My question is that so does the Roboelectric fall into the Instrumented test (which belong to the AndroidTest folder) or the unitTest, because it seems I can't run the test because it hang indefinately.

Also my other question, is how to setup your physical device for instrument and end to end testing efficiently. In many cases, you need to install the app, activate the Display pop up windows while running background for each app and run the testing. Does there any alternative way of doing the instrument / end to end testing in the physical device?


Thanks for reading this. And It will probably my reminder to doing testing in the future
I look up at some SO question about running test on physical device, but none of that are satisfy my question.

79131326,Does EF Core supports `ComplexType` under `Owned` property?,"I'm using ComplexTypeAttribute for some data columns that I want to group together like:
[ComplexType]
public record TrashData(DateTime? Value)
{
    public Identity By { get; init; } = Identity.Unknown;

    private string _reason = string.Empty;
    public string? Reason
    {
        get => _reason;
        init => _reason = string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(value) ? string.Empty : value;
    }

    private static readonly TrashData _available = new TrashData((DateTime?)null);
    public static TrashData Available => _available;
}
[ComplexType]
public record Identity(string IdKind = ""GUID"", string? Value = null)
{
  public static readonly Identity Unknown = new(""_"",""_"");
}

I found no issue adding ComplexType inside another one.
But when I added a ComplexType inside an Owned property like the following:
//(I'm using Asp Identity)
public class User : IdentityUser
{
    public required UserMetaData MetaData { get; set; } = new(default);
}
[Owned]
public record UserMetaData(string Id)
{
    public TrashData Trashed_ { get; set; } = TrashData.Available;
}

I had build issues after generating migration:

I tried to manually specify this property is complex using Fluent Method like this, but it doesn't seem to exist there:
builder.Entity<User>(e =>
{
//  e.ComplexProperty(x => x.MetaData.Trashed_); // Can call ComplexProperty

    e.OwnsOne(
        x => x.MetaData,
        o =>
        {
            o.WithOwner().HasPrincipalKey(x => x.Id).HasForeignKey(x => x.Id);
            // o.ComplexProperty(x => x.Trashed_); // Can't call complex property here.
        }
    );
}

So does EF Core 8 support complex type inside owned property, or not yet?
Note: Migration is generated against SQLite.

The problem is that the `data` state is not being updated when the component mounts, even though the API request is successful and returns the expected data. I've tried adding a `console.log` statement inside the `useEffect` hook to verify that the data is being received correctly, but it's not being logged to the console.

I've also tried using the `useCallback` hook to memoize the `fetch` function, but that didn't make a difference. I've checked the network requests in the browser dev tools and confirmed that the request is being sent and received successfully.

I'm using React 17.0.2 and the `react-dom` package version 17.0.2. I've searched through the React documentation and various online resources, but I couldn't find a solution to this issue. Has anyone else encountered this problem? Any help would be appreciated."
79130607,Why does the Bulma CSS framwork change the z-index on hover?,"I am looking into rendering performance issues of my website and I have found that I get a lot of repaints while just moving the mouse pointer around.
Example: the HTML-Box below the input field and button get a repaint each time I move the mouse pointer (hovering only) between the input and the button in this page (from the official Bulma docs)

I am using the Bulma CSS framework with an ""add-on""-arrangement on some elements. A deeper analysis has show that such buttons and inputs have their z-index changed on hover. The relevant scss code in Bulma is this:
From tools.scss:
  .#{iv.$class-prefix}button,
  .#{iv.$class-prefix}input,
  .#{iv.$class-prefix}select select {
    &:not([disabled]) {
      &:hover,
      &.#{iv.$class-prefix}is-hovered {
        z-index: 2;
      }

      &:focus,
      &.#{iv.$class-prefix}is-focused,
      &:active,
      &.#{iv.$class-prefix}is-active {
        z-index: 3;

        &:hover {
          z-index: 4;
        }
      }
    }
  }

What is the logic behind such a z-index change on hover?
It's causing a ton of repaints on my quite complex website. Do other CSS frameworks have a similar function? I am tempted to remove/neuter these z-index changes.

79130529,Adding a new package broke my Spring Boot Application,"I'm getting troubles since I have added a new package in my spring boot application containing Mapstructs' mappers. Looks like the field:
@Autowired    
private UtenteMapper utenteMapper; 

is not being populated in my Service component. The Spring boot main class, PaniECumpanagghiuApplicationConfiguration, is quite essential, (it contains only the @SpringBootApplicationAnnotation annotation), but I've tried previously to add a @ComponentScan.
@SpringBootApplication    
@ComponentScan(""PaniECumpanagghiu.PaniECumpanagghiu.Mappers"")

In this way the functionality is being recovered, but the @Controller is not fired (when I invoke my API the server retrieves 404). I tried also to add all the packages into the annotation @ComponentScan, like this
@ComponentScan(""PaniECumpanagghiu.PaniECumpanagghiu.Mappers"",""PaniECumpanagghiu.PaniECumpanagghiu.controller"",...)
In this way neither the former object, UtenteMapper, is populated anymore (same behavior than the case without @ComponentScan annotation).
If I comment all references to the new package, and I simplify the API in order to return only a String (""Ciao""), the controller is fired. This is my tree directory

The error message is as follows:

```
java.lang.NullPointerException

```

The relevant code snippet is:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {
 
    @Autowired
    private MyService myService;
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }
 
    public void test() {
        myService.doSomething(); // This line throws NPE
    }
}
```

I've tried to inject the `MyService` bean using `@Autowired`, but it seems to be null when I try to use it in the `test()` method. I've also checked the Spring Boot documentation and tried various solutions, including using `@ComponentScan` and `@BeanDefinitionRegistry`, but nothing seems to work.

I'm using Spring Boot 2.3.0.RELEASE and Java 11. I've also tried debugging the application, but I couldn't find any obvious issues.

Can someone please help me understand why I'm getting this `NullPointerException` and how I can fix it? I've attached the full stacktrace and relevant code snippets for reference.

This title clearly summarizes the main technical issue, uses relevant technical keywords, and is concise and specific. It also takes inspiration from common titles found on Stack Overflow and would be easily searchable.

*Answer*:","I'm experiencing an issue with my remote JVM debug configuration in IntelliJ IDEA. The screenshot shows the configuration settings, but I'm encountering an error message that reads ""Attach to remote JVM"" with a port number of 8000. 

The main issue seems to be related to the debugger mode, as it's set to attach to a remote JVM. The specific components involved are the IntelliJ IDEA IDE and the Tomcat server. This appears to be a configuration issue, as the syntax and runtime seem correct.

To understand this issue, some background information on remote JVM debugging and IntelliJ IDEA's configuration options would be helpful. The relevant framework/language versions are Java 8 and IntelliJ IDEA 2022.1. 

I've tried obvious solutions such as checking the port number and ensuring that the Tomcat server is running. I've also consulted the IntelliJ IDEA documentation on remote JVM debugging. However, I haven't found a solution yet. 

I've attempted to troubleshoot by verifying the Tomcat server's configuration and checking for any firewall issues. I've also searched for similar issues on Stack Overflow, but none of the solutions seem to apply to my specific situation. 

I would appreciate any guidance on how to resolve this issue and successfully attach to the remote JVM for debugging purposes. 

Here is the code snippet related to the configuration:

```java
-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:8000
```

This code snippet is from the IntelliJ IDEA configuration settings, which specifies the JDWP agent library for remote JVM debugging. 

I've also tried modifying the configuration settings, such as changing the port number or disabling the suspend option, but none of these changes have resolved the issue. 

I'm looking for a solution that will allow me to successfully attach to the remote JVM and perform debugging tasks. Any assistance or guidance would be greatly appreciated."
79130391,ShadCN UI and Radix UI Conflict in Vercel Commerce Template After Next.js 15 Update,"I'm facing an issue using ShadCN UI with the Vercel Commerce template after it was updated to Next.js 15. ShadCN UI components worked without issues in the previous version, but now they throw a module resolution error related to Radix UI when imported
Here’s the error I get when I try to use ShadCN UI’s DropdownMenu component:
Module not found: Can't resolve '@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu'
Steps to Reproduce
Clone the latest Vercel Commerce template (Next.js 15).
Install ShadCN UI following the official documentation.
Import and try to use any ShadCN UI component, such as DropdownMenu.
The error appears, preventing the app from compiling.
What I’ve Tried
Removing node_modules and pnpm-lock.yaml, then reinstalling dependencies.
Testing ShadCN UI with a simple Next.js 15 project (without Vercel Commerce); it works fine.
Adding @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu directly to package.json, but it didn’t resolve the issue.
Environment

Next.js Version: 15.0.0-rc.1
Package Manager: pnpm
Vercel Commerce Template: Latest version after Next.js 15 update

Expected Behavior
ShadCN UI should work as expected with the Vercel Commerce template, just like it did with the previous version of Next.js
Question
Is this a known compatibility issue between Radix UI in ShadCN and Vercel Commerce’s dependency versions? If so, are there any workarounds, or will I need to modify dependencies manually to get these components working together?
Additional Info
I’ve noticed that Radix UI components are deeply embedded in ShadCN, which may be causing version conflicts in the Vercel Commerce template. Any guidance on resolving this conflict would be helpful

",['https://i.sstatic.net/OlJSI9r1.png'],"NullPointerException in Java Code: Understanding the Error and Its Resolution**

The provided screenshot displays a Java code snippet within an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), specifically highlighting a section that has triggered a `NullPointerException`. This error occurs when the program attempts to use a reference that points to no location in memory (null) as though it were referencing an object. The code snippet is part of a larger program, but the critical section causing the error is not fully visible. However, the error message indicates that the issue arises from trying to invoke a method or access a field on a null object reference.

**Problem Identification:**

*   **Main Issue:** The primary problem is the `NullPointerException`, which suggests that the code is attempting to perform an operation on an object that has not been initialized.
*   **Components Involved:** The error message points to a specific line of code within a method, indicating that the issue is related to how objects are being handled or initialized within this method.
*   **Type of Issue:** This is a runtime issue, as it occurs during the execution of the program rather than during compilation.

**Title Formulation:**

Given the analysis, a suitable title for this issue would be ""NullPointerException in Java Code: Understanding the Error and Its Resolution."" This title:

This title effectively communicates the nature of the problem and would be useful for developers searching for solutions to `NullPointerExceptions` in their Java code.","I'm trying to implement a custom authentication system using Spring Security in my Java application. However, when I attempt to authenticate a user, I receive a `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException` with the message ""Invalid length"". I've checked my code and ensured that all necessary dependencies are included, but I'm still unable to resolve the issue.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Autowired
    private UserDetailsService userDetailsService;

    @Override
    protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth.userDetailsService(userDetailsService).passwordEncoder(passwordEncoder());
    }

    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers(""/login"").permitAll()
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
                .and()
                .formLogin();
    }
}
```

I've also tried debugging the code and inspecting the request parameters, but I couldn't find any obvious issues. I've checked the Spring Security documentation and searched for similar issues online, but I couldn't find a solution that works for my specific case.

Can someone help me identify the root cause of this error and provide a solution? I've included the full stack trace below for reference:

",['https://i.sstatic.net/UmbnXX8E.png'],"Error in TensorFlow Model Compilation: ""InvalidArgumentError: input to 'sub' Op has type float32 that does not match type float64 of argument 'y'""**","I'm experiencing an issue with my code in the screenshot provided. The IDE being used is Visual Studio Code, and the code appears to be written in Python. There are no error messages visible, but there are some unusual indicators, such as the red lines and circles drawn on the code.

The main issue seems to be related to the configuration of the code, specifically with the import statements and the function definitions. The code is trying to import modules from a specific directory, but it's not clear if the directory exists or if the modules are correctly defined.

To understand this issue, it's necessary to have some background knowledge of Python programming and the specific framework being used. The relevant framework/language versions are Python 3.x and the latest version of the framework.

It's possible that the issue arose due to a misconfiguration of the project structure or a mistake in the import statements. To troubleshoot this issue, I would try to verify the existence of the directory and the modules being imported. I would also check the documentation for the framework and the Python language to ensure that the syntax is correct.

Some obvious solutions that might have been tried include checking the spelling of the import statements, verifying the existence of the directory, and ensuring that the modules are correctly defined. Relevant documentation might include the official Python documentation and the framework's documentation.

Here is the code snippet that is causing the issue:

```python
import os
import sys

# Define the directory path
dir_path = '/path/to/directory'

# Check if the directory exists
if not os.path.exists(dir_path):
    print(""Directory does not exist"")
    sys.exit(1)

# Import modules from the directory
from dir_path import module1, module2

# Define a function
def my_function():
    # Use the imported modules
    module1.do_something()
    module2.do_something_else()

# Call the function
my_function()
```

I've tried to research the issue and attempted to solve it by checking the documentation and verifying the existence of the directory. However, I'm still unable to resolve the issue, and I'm seeking further assistance."

*Answer*:","I'm encountering an issue with my Futex Abstimed Wait function in a multithreaded environment. The function is designed to wait for a specific time period before proceeding, but it's not behaving as expected.

79126371,Override (reintroduce) property with typescript declaration merging,"The base/built-in declaration of Event and GlobalEventHandlersEventMap looks like so:
// lib.dom.d.ts

interface Event {
    /**
     * Returns the type of event, e.g. ""click"", ""hashchange"", or ""submit"".
     */
    readonly type: string;   // <-- note this part
}

interface GlobalEventHandlersEventMap {
    click: MouseEvent;
    //... all sorts of other built in events...
}

Let's say I define an EventTriggered whose constructor has a parameter containing one of the properties named in GlobalEventHandlersEventMap:
class EventTriggered {
    constructor(
        readonly eventName: keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap
    ) {}
}

This means that the following works because there is a property named 'click':
new EventTriggered('click');

But the following will not work (this is ok and intended):
new EventTriggered('some-random-string');

Now I want to use this class inside an event listener, like so:
function onClick(event: Event): void {
    new EventTriggered(event.type);
}

This will fail because as in the first example, event.type contains ""any string"". Type casting could be one way of solving this:
function onClick(event: Event): void {
    new EventTriggered(event.type as keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap);
}

BUT in my opinion, the original declaration of type is wrong - it should not be string, but keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap.
I tried doing that with declaration merging:
// global.d.ts
interface Event {
    readonly type: keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap;
}

What happens then is that the previous error still shows up, but now my IDE shows that type has two declarations:

It looks like GitHub changed the way of latest evaluation from different day timestamps or consider the version number (9-2024 > 17-2024 lexicographically) prior the release timestamp.
Is there a way to fix that? Is it a problem of GitHub or the format of the first part of version number N-Y?
BTW: If list releases by tag then they are ordered right way.

This title clearly summarizes the main technical issue, uses relevant technical keywords, is concise and specific, and would be easily searchable.

*Answer*:","I'm experiencing an issue with my code in the screenshot provided. The IDE being used is Visual Studio Code, and the code appears to be written in C#. The error message displayed is ""CS1061: 'object' does not contain a definition for 'myProperty' and no accessible extension method 'myProperty' accepting a first argument of type 'object' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)"". 

The main issue seems to be a configuration or syntax error, as the code is trying to access a property called ""myProperty"" on an object that does not have this property. The specific components involved are the C# compiler and the Visual Studio Code IDE. 

To understand this issue, it's important to know that C# is a statically-typed language, which means that the compiler checks the types of variables at compile-time. In this case, the compiler is complaining because it cannot find a definition for the ""myProperty"" property on the object being accessed. 

The relevant framework/language versions are .NET Core 3.1 and C# 8.0. It's possible that the code was written in an older version of C# or .NET, where the ""myProperty"" property was available, but it has since been removed or renamed. 

Obvious solutions that might have been tried include checking the spelling of the property name, ensuring that the correct namespace is being used, and verifying that the object being accessed is of the correct type. Relevant documentation includes the official Microsoft documentation for C# and .NET Core, as well as Stack Overflow questions related to this error message. 

Troubleshooting steps that would make sense include checking the project's references and NuGet packages, verifying that the correct version of the .NET Core SDK is installed, and using the debugger to inspect the object being accessed at runtime. 

Overall, the question is specific and answerable, and shows research effort and attempted solutions. The context and problem are clearly explained, and all relevant technical details are included."
79122871,Dynamic Configuration of Facebook Login with react-native-fbsdk-next in Expo,"I am using react-native-fbsdk-next with Expo to implement Facebook login. In order to configure this, I need to include certain settings in app.config.ts, as shown in the image below:

However, I want to avoid hardcoding these values directly in the configuration file. Instead of using environment variables, I would like to fetch these configurations dynamically from an API, allowing me to update them whenever necessary. Since app.config.ts is generated only at build time, is there a way to pass these configurations dynamically?
I came across a potential solution
  const setFBSDKSecrets = async () => {
      const res: SSOType = await API('/auth/get-credentials', {
        method: 'GET',
      })

      Settings.setAppID(res.facebook.clientId)
      Settings.setClientToken(res.facebook.clientToken)
      Settings.setAppName('myApp')
      Settings.setAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled(false)
      Settings.setAutoLogAppEventsEnabled(false)
    }

    setFBSDKSecrets()

I implemented this by adding the settings there and removing them from app.config.ts. However, when I ran yarn start, I encountered an error stating that the appID is missing:
Error: missing appID in the plugin properties

Can anyone provide solution on how to resolve this issue or suggest a better approach for dynamically configuring Facebook login settings in Expo?

79121996,VIM snippet (UltiSnips): pad line until column 80 reached with a character,"The code I often work at has a comment style like
#---------------------------------------------
# this is a comment
#---------------------------------------------
this.is_code()

I wanted to write a VIM snippet (using UltiSnips) that pads the comment box up until column number 80 (or better until vims colorcolumn). It should take the indentation level into account and always fill the dashes up until column 80.
I have a working snippet present that looks like this
snippet #
#`!p snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
# $1
#`!p snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
$0
endsnippet

Problem here is that when I start typing the number of dashes moves back. Because while I enter a comment the cursor I use in the snipept moves.
I think I need a pyhton or VIM variable that holdes the lines column from which I can subtract 80. But I can't find anything that works for this case.
Edit:
I've found one possible solution to avoid the moving dashes in the template by checking snip.c By checking for emptyness I can make sure that interpolation is done only once.
snippet #
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
# $1
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
$0
endsnippet

Unfortunately since I still have not found a replacement for using the current cursor position vim.current.window.cursor I get wrong lengths for snippets that have comments in indented blocks. For example:
snippet if
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
# if comment
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
IF( $1 )
   #`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
   # inside if
   #`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
   $0
   #`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`

        User user = userRepository.findByUsername(username);
        if (user == null) {
            throw new UsernameNotFoundException(""User not found"");
        }

Error Message: 
No such module 'CheckingApp' 

Relevant Code: 
```swift
import XCTest
@testable import CheckingApp

class UnitTests: XCTestCase {
    // ...
}
```
I've tried changing the import statement to `import CheckingApp`, but that doesn't work either. I've also tried checking the target membership of the test file, but it's set to the correct target. 

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance."

But I am unable to see accessibilityIdentifier for Button, TitleLabel and descriptionLabel in AccessibilityInspector. what am I doing wrong here?
PS: I also followed below video :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAqzXI3kFCk
This is a working solution
 dataDisclosureView.accessibilityElements = [dataDisclosureView as Any,

        if #available(iOS 17.0, *) {
            dataDisclosureView.automationElements =  [titleLabel as Any,

                                             hintLabel as Any]
        } else {
            // Fallback on earlier versions
        }

but I am not satisfied with that because in one of Apple WWDC video it was mentioned that if we want exempt item from voice over accessibility don't add it in accessibilityItems and if we want in automation elements just add it. They haven't provided deeper details . Reference is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAqzXI3kFCk also adding screenshot about what I am saying
According to this it should be

The issue arises when I attempt to access a specific component's data within a nested route.

    component: Home
  },
  {
    path: '/about',

        name: 'child',
        component: Child
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

In the `Child` component, I'm attempting to access the `about` component's data using the `$root` property, like so:

```javascript
<template>
  <div>
    {{ $root.aboutData }}
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      aboutData: 'This is some data from the about component'
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

However, when I navigate to the `/about/child` route, the `aboutData` is not displayed. I've tried using the `this.$parent` property to access the parent component's data, but it returns `undefined`.

I've also attempted to use the `vuex` store to manage the state, but I'm unsure how to access the store's state within the child component.

I've consulted the Vue.js documentation and various online resources, but I'm still struggling to find a solution. Can someone please help me understand what I'm doing wrong and provide a working example of how to access the parent component's data within a child component in a nested route?

79120927,Complex object not showing inner classes in shema,"I'm consuming an external wsdl using wsdltophp. This is generating me a large class structure which I would like to make consumable by my API via SwaggerUI.

The generated swagger entry point looks like this now:

Where all the inner classes of my main class are represented by strings. If we just take a look at the first Property (IDFactura), this is the code generated by wsdltophp
     /**
     * The IDFactura
     * @var \App\Application\ServiceReferences\Verifactu\StructType\IDFacturaExpedidaType|null
     * @OA\Property()
     */
    protected ?\App\Application\ServiceReferences\Verifactu\StructType\IDFacturaExpedidaType $IDFactura = null;

(The @OA\Schema is also generated by wsdltophp) But it's clear that my SwaggerUI is representing this inner class like a simple string.
Since this WSDL is external and I have no control over it, nor the wsdltophp generated code, I'm looking for a solution which would avoid updating/modifying those external classes

The screenshot shows the code I've written so far, which includes the class definition and some properties. However, when I try to compile the code, I get an error message indicating that there's a problem with the DateTime property.

After researching the issue, I found that the DateTime property is not properly initialized, which is causing the error.

I've also checked the documentation for the QualificationModel class, but I couldn't find any information on how to properly initialize the DateTime property.

I've tried the following solutions:

* Setting the DateTime property to a default value using the DateTime.Now property
* Initializing the DateTime property in the constructor of the QualificationModel class
* Using the DateTime.ParseExact method to parse a string representation of the date and time

However, none of these solutions seem to work. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong or what else I can try to resolve this issue. Can someone please help me understand what's going on and provide a solution?

""script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval' 'inline-speculation-rules' http://localhost:* http://127.0.0.1:*"".

Some additional context:

The extension uses Vite and React.
The error started appearing suddenly, and the extension was working fine previously.
I am not explicitly loading any external scripts apart from the ones within the extension.
My CSP currently allows 'self' and 'wasm-unsafe-eval' under script-src.
I've tried to debug this but can’t seem to pinpoint what might be causing this issue.

My questions:

What might be the cause of this error if nothing has changed in my extension?
How can I resolve the CSP issue to allow the script to load properly?
Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

In this code, `myObject` is not initialized before being used in the `myMethod()` method, leading to the null pointer exception.

To solve this issue, I have tried initializing the `myObject` variable before using it, but I'm unsure if this is the correct approach. I've also checked the documentation for the Eclipse IDE and the Java language, but I couldn't find any specific guidance on how to handle this situation.

Here's my attempt at initializing the `myObject` variable:

The component in question is a custom-built chart that utilizes the D3.js library for data visualization. 

When I attempt to render this component within my React application, it fails to display correctly. Instead, I receive an error message indicating that there is a conflict between the React and D3.js libraries. Specifically, the error points to a mismatch in the version of the React library being used by my application and the version expected by the D3.js library.

I've tried updating the React library to the latest version, but this hasn't resolved the issue. I've also reviewed the documentation for both React and D3.js, looking for any known compatibility issues or workarounds, but so far, I haven't found a solution.

Here's a snippet of the code where the error occurs:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import * as d3 from 'd3';

const ChartComponent = () => {
  // D3.js code to generate the chart
  const chart = d3.select('body')

The built-in Search icon is misaligned (see screenshot below). It was ok before.

The screenshot also shows the automatic kendo-popup tag in the Browser Developer tools, seen when a user clicks in Choose Document Type dropdown. As this popup is very dynamic, I can't inspect further the Search icon in Developer Tools to see the automatic Kendo HTML tags and CSS classes so that I can potentially override a CSS class related to the icon.
How can I align the Search icon properly (to be at the beginning of the input field and vertically seen fully)?
",['https://i.sstatic.net/VWdcjLth.png'],"Error in Code: ""TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined"" in JavaScript Function","I'm trying to implement a feature in my web application using React and Redux. The goal is to fetch data from an API and display it in a table. However, I'm encountering an issue where the data is not being updated in the table even after the API call is successful.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

```jsx

import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { fetchPosts } from '../actions';

const PostsTable = ({ posts, fetchPosts }) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchPosts();
  }, [fetchPosts]);

          <th>ID</th>
          <th>Title</th>
          <th>Content</th>

        {posts.map(post => (
          <tr key={post.id}>

            <td>{post.title}</td>
            <td>{post.content}</td>

      </tbody>
    </table>
  );
};

const mapStateToProps = state => {
  return { posts: state.posts };
};

export default connect(mapStateToProps, { fetchPosts })(PostsTable);
```

The `fetchPosts` action is defined as follows:

```js
export const fetchPosts = () => {
  return dispatch => {
    fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_POSTS_SUCCESS', payload: data }));
  };
};
```

In the Redux store, I have the following reducer:

```js
const initialState = {
  posts: []
};

const postsReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'FETCH_POSTS_SUCCESS':
      return { ...state, posts: action.payload };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default postsReducer;
```

When I run the application, the table remains empty, and there are no error messages in the console. I've tried debugging by adding console logs in the `fetchPosts` action and the `postsReducer`, but they don't seem to be triggered.

I've also checked the network requests in the browser dev tools, and the API call is successful, returning the expected data. However, the data is not being updated in the table.

I've searched for similar issues online, but most solutions suggest using `useEffect` with an empty dependency array, which I've already tried. I've also tried using `useCallback` to memoize the `fetchPosts` function, but that didn't work either.

Can someone help me identify the issue and provide a solution?"

",['https://i.sstatic.net/GPA2iHgQ.png'],Error in Importing 'Function' from 'lib.ar': Unrecognized Function Name**,"I'm experiencing an issue with my code in the screenshot provided. The IDE being used is IntelliJ IDEA, and the code appears to be written in Java. There are no error messages visible in the screenshot, but there is an unusual indicator - a red underline under the variable ""result"" in the line ""System.out.println(result);"". This suggests that there might be a syntax or runtime issue related to this variable.

The main issue seems to be that the variable ""result"" is not defined or initialized before it's being used in the print statement. The specific component involved is the variable ""result"". This appears to be a syntax issue, as the code is trying to use a variable that hasn't been declared or initialized.

To understand this issue, some background information on Java programming is needed. The relevant framework/language version is Java 8, which is the version used in the screenshot. It's possible that the developer forgot to declare or initialize the variable ""result"" before using it, or there might be a typo in the variable name.

Obvious solutions that might have been tried include declaring and initializing the variable ""result"" before using it, or checking for typos in the variable name. Relevant documentation might include the Java documentation for variables and data types. Troubleshooting steps would involve checking the code for any syntax errors, ensuring that all variables are properly declared and initialized, and using a debugger to step through the code and identify the issue.

Here is the code snippet from the screenshot:

79089650,Laravel Broadcasting not firing on the Job Queue,"I am creating a AI ChatBot. The message is entered on the frontend (Livewire) and then stored in the database. A model ""created"" listener then pushes a job onto the queue which asks the AI (LLM) the prompt and the answer is then updated on the model (on the queue). There is then an ""updated"" listener, which fires a broadcasting event.
On the front end the Livewire component is listening via Laravel Echo for the updated event, and the chat response is shown to the user.
The problem I have is that the broadcasting event works, but not on the queue. I have tested it via a Console Command and it updates the chat, but when the job is processed on the queue, no update occurs.
I have checked the Herd logs, and again, I can see the event broadcasting when I manually trigger with the Console Command, but no event is broadcasted when the job is processed on the queue.
So:

The job to get the llm response is always successfully processed on the queue when the model is created
The LlmMessage model is always updated successfully by this job, and the response is stored
The LlmMessageUpdated event is broadcasted and the Livewire Component updated when a manual update is triggered
The LlmMessageUpdated event is not broadcasted and the Livewire Component is not updated when the job updates the model

The IDE being used is Visual Studio Code, and the code appears to be written in Python. There are no error messages or unusual indicators visible in the screenshot.

The main issue seems to be related to the ""App\events"" and ""App\events\LimMessageUpdated"" components. The code is attempting to handle events and update messages, but it's unclear what specific problem is occurring.

To understand this issue, some background information on event handling and message updating in Python would be helpful. The relevant framework/language versions are Python 3.x and the latest version of the events library.

It's possible that the issue is due to a configuration, syntax, or runtime problem. Some obvious solutions that might have been tried include checking the event handling code, verifying the message updating logic, and ensuring that the necessary dependencies are installed.

Relevant documentation that might be helpful includes the Python documentation on event handling and the events library documentation. Some troubleshooting steps that would make sense include printing out debug messages to see where the issue is occurring, using a debugger to step through the code, and checking the event handling code for any syntax errors.

I've tried researching the issue and attempting some solutions, but I haven't been able to resolve the problem yet. I'm hoping someone with more experience can provide some guidance on how to fix this issue.

This increased the time it took to write out the data.
So I tried to set write.distribution-mode to none like the one below.

Moreover, it appears from the latest metadata file on hdfs that this setting was successful.

This title clearly summarizes the main technical issue, uses relevant technical keywords, is concise and specific, and takes inspiration from trained data on Stack Overflow. It would also be easily searchable.

*Answer*:","I'm trying to implement a digital art showcase using blockchain technology, but I'm running into issues with my code. The screenshot shows my IDE, which is Visual Studio Code, and the code I've written so far. I'm using Solidity as the programming language and Truffle Suite as the framework.

The main issue I'm facing is that my contract is not deploying correctly to the blockchain. I've tried various solutions, including checking my gas limit and adjusting my contract's constructor, but nothing seems to be working. I've also consulted the Truffle Suite documentation and searched for similar issues on Stack Overflow, but I haven't found a solution yet.

Here's my code:
```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract DigitalArtShowcase {
    // ...
}
```
I've tried deploying the contract using the Truffle Suite's `truffle migrate` command, but I keep getting an error message saying that the contract is not deployed. I've also tried using the `truffle console` command to interact with the contract, but I get an error message saying that the contract is not found.

I've done some research and found that this issue might be related to the version of Solidity I'm using. I've tried updating my Solidity version to the latest one, but it didn't solve the problem. I've also tried using a different framework, such as OpenZeppelin, but I'm not sure if it's compatible with my current setup.

I would appreciate any help or guidance on how to resolve this issue. Thank you for your time and expertise."
79085902,pymysql use commit still can't insert,"Even using the commit() with pymysql, insert statement has no effect.
Hi, this is my first time posting here, and I hope someone can solve my problem.
I am using VS2022 to compile the following code in a Python 3.12 environment:
import pymysql

conn_test = pymysql.connect(host='localhost', port=3306, user='root', passwd='****', charset='utf8', db='pythonTest', autocommit=True)

with conn_test.cursor() as cursor:
    1

        ('Tony', 170, 56),

        ('Jack', 185, 83);
    """"""
    cursor.execute(sql_insert)

    conn_test.commit()

conn_test.close()

I have already confirmed that the pymysql.connect command works correctly, and I have used it to create the 'members' table.
import pymysql

conn_test = pymysql.connect(host='localhost', port=3306, user='root', passwd='****', charset='utf8', db='pythonTest')

with  conn_test.cursor() as cursor:
    sql_create = """"""

    Height int(6),
    Weight int(6)
    );
    """"""

    cursor.execute(sql_create)

    conn_test.commit()

conn_test.close()

I can see that the 'members' table was created using MySQL Workbench, but no matter how many times I refresh or rerun the code, the 'members' table doesn't contain data like Tony and others.
Since I'm not very familiar with pymysql, I'm not sure where the problem is. Could anyone help me solve this issue?
===2024/10/19 Update===
Hello everyone, I’ve been dealing with other matters during this time, so I apologize for not responding earlier. Here’s an update with the current Insert statement code, along with an image of the execution result.
import pymysql

conn_test = pymysql.connect(host='localhost', port=3306, user='root', passwd='exagger2024SQL', charset='utf8', db='pythonTest', autocommit=True)

    sql_insert = """"""

        (3, 'Jack', 185, 83)
    """"""
    try:
        cursor.execute(sql_insert)

        conn_test.commit()
    except Exception as e:
        conn_test.rollback()

        print(e);

conn_test.close()


As you can see, this piece of code doesn’t seem to show any errors, because if there were compilation errors, the 'try' and 'except' should have caught them, but they didn’t.
At the same time, the SQL database still doesn’t have any data like Tony and others.
Since I’m new to this, I’m feeling a bit lost. I really hope I can resolve this issue. In addition to continuing my research, I sincerely ask for your help. Thank you guys.

",['https://i.sstatic.net/Z4xqkJ5m.png'],"""AssertionError: assert 'hello' == 'world' failed""","I'm trying to implement a feature in my web application using Python and the Flask framework. The goal is to handle user input and perform specific actions based on the input received. However, I'm encountering an issue where the application fails to process the input correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

The error message I receive is ""AssertionError: assert 'hello' == 'world'"". This suggests that there's a mismatch between the expected and actual values. Upon reviewing my code, I realize that I've made an incorrect assumption about the user's input.

To troubleshoot this issue, I've tried several approaches:

1. **Checking the User Input**: I've added print statements to verify the value of the user's input. This helps me understand what the user is entering and how it's being processed by the application.
2. **Reviewing the Code Logic**: I've carefully reviewed the logic of my code to ensure that it accurately reflects the desired behavior. This involves checking the conditional statements and the actions taken based on the user's input.
3. **Consulting Documentation**: I've consulted the Flask documentation to ensure that I'm using the correct methods and functions to handle user input. This helps me identify any potential mistakes or areas for improvement.

Despite these efforts, I'm still struggling to resolve the issue. I believe that there might be a fundamental flaw in my approach or a misunderstanding of how Flask handles user input. I would appreciate any guidance or insights that could help me overcome this challenge.

Here's a simplified version of my code to illustrate the problem:

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['POST'])
def handle_input():
    user_input = request.form['input']
    if user_input == 'hello':
        return 'world'
    else:
        return 'invalid input'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this example, I'm expecting the user to enter 'hello', but the application is not processing the input correctly. I'm hoping that someone can point out the mistake and provide a solution to this problem."

Can you tell me what technique is used for that? I can rephrase a question: how to dynamically generate a DOM Element, a template of which is managed by Angular. I even fine if change detection will not work automatically (it probably won't).
I pulled a source repo and it's content is very strange to me. I see how the eventContent is read from @contentChildren but nothing happens with it after.

I'm using Python 3.8.5 and the latest version of the `requests` library. I've tried running the code on different machines and environments, but the issue persists.

I'd appreciate any help in identifying the root cause of this issue and finding a solution. Thank you!

",['https://i.sstatic.net/MnLRVDpB.png'],"Error in Geometric Transformation: ""geometric"" not defined in Python Code","I'm trying to implement a custom authentication system using Django's built-in authentication framework. However, when I attempt to log in with a valid username and password, I receive a ""NoneType"" error. The error message indicates that the `user` object is `None`, which suggests that the authentication process is not correctly retrieving the user instance.

I've reviewed the Django documentation and ensured that my `User` model is properly defined and registered in the `AUTH_USER_MODEL` setting. I've also verified that the `username` and `password` fields are correctly populated in the `User` model.

To troubleshoot this issue, I've tried printing the `user` object before and after the authentication attempt to see if it's being correctly retrieved. However, the `user` object remains `None` even after a successful authentication attempt.

Here's the relevant code snippet:
```python
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate, login
from django.http import HttpResponse

def login_view(request):
    username = request.POST['username']
    password = request.POST['password']
    user = authenticate(request, username=username, password=password)
    if user is not None:
        login(request, user)
        return HttpResponse('Login successful!')
    else:
        return HttpResponse('Invalid username or password.')
```
I've also checked the Django documentation for any known issues or edge cases related to custom authentication, but I couldn't find any relevant information.

I would appreciate any guidance on how to resolve this issue and correctly implement custom authentication in Django."
79050210,Azure DevOps. Can't trigger a pipeline in Repo A when a commit is done in repo B,"I’m using Version Dev17.M153.5 (TFS), and I have two repositories: my source code is hosted in Repo B, and my pipelines are hosted in Repo A to keep responsibilities separated.
My goal is for the pipeline in Repo A to automatically run whenever a commit is pushed to Repo B. Below is my current setup:
# MY MAIN PIPELINE IN REPO A:
trigger: none
resources:
  repositories:
    - repository: RepoB
      type: git
      name: Project/RepoB
      ref: develop
      trigger:
        branches:
          include:
            - develop
            - master

pool:
  name: 'Test'

variables:
  REPO_URL: 'https://tfs.company.com/company/Project/_git/RepoB'

steps:
  - task: PowerShell@2
    displayName: 'Configurar encabezado GIT_AUTH_HEADER con PAT'
    inputs:
      targetType: 'inline'
      script: |
        # Crear el encabezado de autenticación en formato Base64
        $headerValue = ""Authorization: Basic "" + [Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes("":"" + $env:PAT))

        git -c http.extraheader=""$headerValue"" clone $(REPO_URL)
    env:
      PAT: $(PAT)  # El PAT como variable de entorno secreta

    #Templates
  - ${{ if eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/master') }}:
    - template: pipeline-master.yml

  - ${{ if eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/develop') }}:
    - template: pipeline-develop.yml

The Issue:
This pipeline does not trigger automatically when a commit is pushed to Repo B on either develop or master. I cannot use checkout because it only accepts self or none. However, Repo B is successfully cloned, and the pipeline runs fine if I trigger it manually
Additional Considerations:

Build services have ""Read and Contribute"" permissions set to ""Allow"" in both repositories.
Both Repo A and Repo B are part of the same project.
The Personal Access Token (PAT) is correctly configured, and the pipeline passes when executed manually.


Question:
Why is the pipeline not triggering automatically, and how can I ensure it runs whenever a commit is pushed to Repo B?
Update
I have read many posts warning about compiling the YAML file in the default branch. I am compiling it in master, which is my default branch, and still doesn't work
Many thanks in advance!
",['https://i.sstatic.net/820vUuoT.png'],"Error in Store Pipelines YAML File: ""Could not queue the build because there were validation errors or warnings""**","I'm experiencing an issue with my code in the screenshot provided. The IDE being used is Visual Studio Code, and the code appears to be written in Python. There are no error messages or unusual indicators visible in the screenshot.

The main issue seems to be related to the configuration of the pipelines.yml file. The specific components involved are the store pipelines.yml and the trigger: none. This suggests that the issue might be related to the way the pipelines are being triggered or configured.

To understand this issue, some background information on the programming language and framework being used would be helpful. The relevant framework/language versions are Python 3.x and the latest version of the pipelines library. It's possible that the issue arose due to a misconfiguration of the pipelines or a syntax error in the pipelines.yml file.

Some obvious solutions that might have been tried include checking the syntax of the pipelines.yml file, verifying the configuration of the pipelines, and ensuring that the necessary dependencies are installed. Relevant documentation might include the official pipelines library documentation and the Python documentation for the specific version being used. Troubleshooting steps could involve checking the logs for any error messages, verifying the configuration of the pipelines, and testing the pipelines with a minimal example.

I've tried checking the syntax of the pipelines.yml file and verifying the configuration of the pipelines, but I haven't been able to resolve the issue. I've also reviewed the relevant documentation and tried troubleshooting steps, but I'm still experiencing the problem. I would appreciate any guidance on how to resolve this issue."

When I researched this problem, the solution says if you are using a nullable command you need to use a length like this: @Column(nullable = false, length = 4096) and this does not solve my problem.
Wrong but If I can't solve I'm gonna add a Soft Delete endpoint with PUT annotation and just update is_deleted part to true.
Thank you for your help!
Edit: When I delete these lines problem is solved but delete is not soft anymore:
@SQLDelete(sql = ""UPDATE permission SET is_deleted = true WHERE id=?"")
@Where(clause = ""is_deleted=false"")

",['https://i.sstatic.net/FyOBqpDV.png'],"Error in C++ Code: ""No matching function for call to 'std::vector<int>::push_back(int)'**

**Explanation:**

*   The screenshot shows a C++ code snippet with an error message.
*   The error message indicates that there is no matching function for the call to `std::vector<int>::push_back(int)`.
*   This suggests that the issue is related to the use of the `push_back` function on a `std::vector` object.
*   The title is concise, specific, and includes relevant technical keywords, making it easily searchable.","I'm experiencing an issue with my code in the screenshot provided. The IDE being used is IntelliJ IDEA, and the code appears to be written in Java. There are no error messages visible in the screenshot, but there is an unusual indicator - a red underline under the variable ""response"" in the line ""Response response = new Response();"". This suggests that there might be a syntax or configuration issue.

The main issue seems to be related to the ""Response"" class, which is not defined in the provided code snippet. It's possible that the class is not imported correctly or that there is a typo in the class name. To resolve this issue, I would first check the import statements to ensure that the correct package is being imported. If the issue persists, I would try to define the ""Response"" class or check if it's a built-in class in the Java framework.

I've tried searching for documentation on the ""Response"" class, but couldn't find any relevant information. I've also tried troubleshooting steps such as checking the project structure and dependencies, but nothing seems to work. I would appreciate any help in resolving this issue.

Here is the code snippet for reference:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Response response = new Response();
    }
}
```

",['https://i.sstatic.net/IYFJ3HWk.png'],Error in WebAssembly Translation: Expected 'C' but Found 'C' in Christmas Index.js,"I'm encountering an issue while attempting to convert a string to a binary using the `binascii` module in Python. The error message I receive is ""Error when converting wat: expected 'C'"". 

Here's the relevant code snippet:

```python
import binascii

def convert_to_binary(input_string):
    try:
        binary_data = binascii.unhexlify(input_string)
        return binary_data

# Example usage
input_string = ""Hello, World!""
binary_data = convert_to_binary(input_string)
if binary_data is not None:
    print(binary_data)
```

The error occurs when I pass a string that is not a valid hexadecimal representation to the `convert_to_binary` function. I've tried using the `binascii.hexlify()` function to convert the string to hexadecimal before passing it to `binascii.unhexlify()`, but this doesn't resolve the issue.

I've also consulted the Python documentation for `binascii` and searched for similar issues on Stack Overflow, but I couldn't find a solution that applies to my specific situation. 

Can someone help me understand why I'm getting this error and how I can fix it? Is there a way to handle non-hexadecimal strings gracefully, or should I add additional error checking before attempting the conversion? 

I appreciate any guidance or insights you can provide."

    card_number: string;
    role: string;
    permissions?: Types.ObjectId[];
  }

When running console log for debugging:
console.log(data);
console.log(data?.role)

I get the following response:

79048500,Angular 17 refuses to instance component,"I cannt reproduce it with anything, and I'm completely out of explanations for why it coudl be happening... I have the following component (with sideElementIs3d set to true, so it shows the threes-js app):

   <div *ngIf=""!sideElementIs3d"" [ngStyle]=""{'background-image':' url(assets/img/right.png)'}"">
   </div>
   <app-three-js-interactive *ngIf=""sideElementIs3d""></app-three-js-interactive>
</div>

And the app-three-js-interactive component:
<canvas #canvas></canvas>

I have spent roughly 5 hours now, trying to figure out why the app-three-js-interactive is not created, and my HTML inspector just looks like this with absolutely nothing inside the component. No constructor call, no ngInit, no ngAfterViewInit, nothing...

Even after removing all the code from the component it still does not instantiate anything

@Component({
  selector: 'app-three-js-interactive',
  templateUrl: './three-js-interactive.component.html'
})
export class ThreeJsInteractiveComponent implements AfterViewInit {

  }

  ngAfterViewInit(): void {
    console.log(""help!"")
  }

It does work in a different location which is puzzling me even more... Does anyone have any idea why this is happening, or any other info you need to help me figure out what is going on...

79044080,is getenv_s not part of cstdlib?,"C11 added new bounds-checked functions to the standard library, such as getenv_s.
However, when I include <cstdlib>, I do not have std::getenv_s, only getenv_s (global namespace).

Even when I define __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ as 1, My compiler (MSVC C++23) does not find the std::getenv_s function.

I've also checked the API documentation, which mentions rate limits but doesn't provide specific guidance on handling this error.

I've searched for similar issues on Stack Overflow and found suggestions to implement exponential backoff or use a library like `tenacity` for retries. However, I'm unsure about the best approach to handle this scenario effectively.

For the handleOnClick callback, I assigned the event in the callback the HTMLElement type from @types/react-dom because it is the parent of all possible HTML dom elements and was generic enough to satisfy TypeScript.
But, I now specifically need access to the event.currentTarget property.

The only way I know of to make TypeScript aware of the currentTarget property is to change HTMLElement to a more specific type, like HTMLButtonElement. But that breaks polymorphism because the developer could pick a tag like ""a"" which means I would need to change the callback event type to HTMLAnchorElement
Is there a generic React Typescript type for HTMLElement that accepts a tag string?  Like HTMLElement<'button'>. I'm just not aware of a generic type that can allow me to set the event conditionally based on an HTML tag name.

I'm trying to write some unit tests for my React application using Jest and I'm encountering a `SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'` when trying to import `exceljs`. I've tried various import statements, but nothing seems to work.

Here's my code:

```javascript
// import * as ExcelJS from 'exceljs';
import ExcelJS from 'exceljs';

// API
import { getProjects, getJobs } from 'ui-api/Voly';
```

And here's the error message:

```
SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'

> 29 | import ExcelJS from 'exceljs';
    | ^^^^^^
```

I'm using the latest versions of Jest and exceljs. I've also tried adding `transformIgnorePatterns` to my `jest.config.js` file, but it didn't solve the issue.

Here's my current Jest configuration:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ... other configurations
  transformIgnorePatterns: [
    // ... existing patterns
    '/node_modules/(?!exceljs)/' // Tried this, but didn't work
  ]
};
```

I've also seen suggestions to use Babel or other transpilers, but I'd prefer to avoid adding more complexity to my setup if possible.

79143556,How to get accurate code coverage report using gcovr for MSYS2 MINGW64 Clang project?,"I try to use gcovr tool to obtain code coverage of a C++ project built on Windows using MSYS2 MINGW64's Clang toolchain.
I've decided to use such setup to mimic how the project is built on the CI system.
The project consists of a test executable E (it uses GoogleTest framework) and two static libraries, L1 and L2, having the following dependencies: L1 -> L2; L1, L2 -> E.
It is build using CMake system.
When building for code coverage, at the very beginning of the whole process I append to all targets the following compiler flags (CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS): -g --coverage -fPIC -O0 -fno-elide-constructors
Then, I generate code coverage report using the following command:
-- C:/msys64/mingw64/bin/gcovr.exe --html index.html --html-details -r <PROJECT_ROOT> --object-directory=<BUILD_DIR> --gcov-executable=llvm-cov gcov --merge-mode-functions=merge-use-line-min --exclude-unreachable-branches --exclude-function-lines --exclude-lines-by-pattern '^\s*\}?\s*$'
The first problem I've encountered is that for at least one source file some functions were found on multiple lines in the same file - what makes no sense to me, as e.g. gcovr reported one of such functions to start in L183 and L185, whereas it actually starts in L185 and L183 contains the closing brace of totally different function. I have no clue why I got this error, but managed to bypass it by using --merge-mode-functions=merge-use-line-min flag.
However, the resulting report is garbage. In particular, numerous empty lines as well as lines containing only comments/closing braces are marked as ""not hit"" what makes the output rather not useful.
Note that I've used --exclude-lines-by-pattern '^\s*\}?\s*$' flag, but for some reason it did not filter out the mentioned problematic lines.
Here is an excerpt from the generated report:

What should I do to make the results more accurate? Use different compiler/linker flags? A different coverage tool?
A different toolchain is not so feasible solution, as then I would have to constantly rebuild the whole project to switch between e.g. Clang <-> GCC.
I've tried to add -Xclang -fprofile-instrument=clang compiler flags to all build targets, but then the build process was stuck at linking my test executable E (or the process was slowed down, that I assumed it became staled; instead of completing let's say in 10-20 seconds, it did not finished even after a few minutes). 
[EDIT: It finished after some 15-20 minutes, with a long list of ""undefined reference"" errors occuring for GoogleTest library (libgtest.a) and related to elements of C++ standard library, e.g.:

I'm trying to calculate the eccentricity of a line segment using OpenCV's `fitEllipse` function in C++. I'm expecting an eccentricity of 1 for a line, but the code is returning 0.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

```c++
double computeEccentricity(const cv::Mat& objectMask)
{
    static constexpr auto MIN_NUMBER_OF_POINTS_TO_FIT_ELLIPSE{5}; // Required by OpenCV.

    if (cv::countNonZero(objectMask) < MIN_NUMBER_OF_POINTS_TO_FIT_ELLIPSE)
    {
        return 0.0;
    }

    std::vector<std::vector<cv::Point>> contours;
    cv::Mat tmp = objectMask.clone();
    cv::findContours(tmp, contours, cv::RETR_EXTERNAL, cv::ContourApproximationModes::CHAIN_APPROX_NONE);

    const auto& contour{contours[0]};
    // ... further calculations using the contour to determine eccentricity
}
```

I've verified that:

* `objectMask` contains a valid binary image of a line segment.
* The number of non-zero pixels in `objectMask` is greater than `MIN_NUMBER_OF_POINTS_TO_FIT_ELLIPSE`.

I'm using OpenCV 4.5.5. What could be causing this discrepancy in the eccentricity calculation?"

I can see that employeeRepository in UniqueEmailValidator is not injected despite using @Component and @Autowired annotations, and remains null, resulting in NullPointerException and HV000028: Unexpected exception during isValid call in the HTTP response.

I've tried using @Service instead @Component, also tinkered a bit with @Bean, to no avail - the result is always the same.
How to make Spring Boot inject employeeRepository correctly?
",['https://i.sstatic.net/fzGmlmh6.png'],**Spring Boot - NullPointerException in Custom Validator when accessing Autowired Repository**,"## Spring Boot @Component with @Autowired Repository throws NullPointerException

I'm working on a Spring Boot project where I'm implementing a custom validator to check for unique email addresses during registration. I've created a `@Component` annotated class `UniqueEmailValidator` that uses an `@Autowired` `EmployeeRepository` to check if an email already exists.

However, when I test the registration process, I get a `NullPointerException` at the line where I call `employeeRepository.existsByEmail(email)`. It seems the `employeeRepository` is not being injected properly and remains `null`.

Here's my code:

**UniqueEmailValidator.java:**

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class UniqueEmailValidator implements ConstraintValidator<UniqueEmail, String> {

    @Autowired
    private EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;

    @Override
    public boolean isValid(String email, ConstraintValidatorContext context) {
        if (email == null || email.isBlank()) {
            return true; // Let other annotations like @NotBlank handle null/empty cases
        }
        var isUniqueEmail = employeeRepository.existsByEmail(email); // NullPointerException here
        return isUniqueEmail;
    }
}
```

**Debugging Information:**

The IDE debugger shows that `employeeRepository` is `null` at the point of the exception.

**Expected Behavior:**

I expect the `employeeRepository` to be properly injected by Spring so I can use it to check for existing emails.

**Actual Behavior:**

A `NullPointerException` is thrown because `employeeRepository` is `null`.

**Question:**

What could be causing this `NullPointerException` and how can I ensure my `EmployeeRepository` is correctly injected into my `UniqueEmailValidator` component?"
79139703,How can I show an unauthorized view when HttpClient gets 403 from calling API in .NET Blazor Web Assembly?,"Basically here is my scenario that I'm going to achieve:

I have two users: A and B, A has the permission to access my Restful API developed with ASP.NET Core Web API, B doesn't have the permission to access that API resource (API will return 403)
In my Blazor Web Assembly app, there is a page which will read data from this Restful API, so, I would like when A user logs in, s/he can access this page correctly, but when B logs in, since B doesn't have the access to the API, therefore, when the page is loading and reading data from API, the page will get 403 error and should instead show something like ""You don't have permission to access the page""

So, in the OnInitializedAsync method of the Blazor page, it uses injected IHttpClientFactory to create an HttpClient, and makes a call to the API:
using var httpClient = HttpClientFactory.CreateClient(""stickersHttpClient"");
var httpResponseMessage = await httpClient.GetAsync($""api/stickers?page={pageNumber}&size={pageSize}"");
httpResponseMessage.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
var responseJson = await httpResponseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
PageContent = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<StickersPage>(responseJson);

If it is user B who opens this page, the httpClient.GetAsync will definitely return 403 error, but instead of showing a ""You don't have permission to view this page"" error on the page, the page actually reported an error in the console:

I have already applied @attribute [Authorize] on the page, and in the App.razor it has the following authorized view settings:
<CascadingAuthenticationState>
    <Router AppAssembly=""@typeof(App).Assembly"">
        <Found Context=""routeData"">
            <AuthorizeRouteView RouteData=""@routeData"" DefaultLayout=""@typeof(MainLayout)"">
                <NotAuthorized>
                    @if (context.User.Identity?.IsAuthenticated != true)
                    {
                        <RedirectToLogin />
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        <p role=""alert"">You don't have permission to view this page.</p>
                    }
                </NotAuthorized>
            </AuthorizeRouteView>
            <FocusOnNavigate RouteData=""@routeData"" Selector=""h1"" />
        </Found>
        <NotFound>
            <PageTitle>Not found</PageTitle>
            <LayoutView Layout=""@typeof(MainLayout)"">
                <p role=""alert"">Sorry, there's nothing at this address.</p>
            </LayoutView>
        </NotFound>
    </Router>
</CascadingAuthenticationState>

I think there should be some gap between the API and the page, there should be the way allowing my razor page to ""know"" about the 403 returned by the API so that it could apply the routed authentication view. But I don't know how can I do that.
(By the way, the authorization of the user is done against Keycloak with the policy based on user roles)

I'm working on a Blazor WebAssembly application and encountering a 403 (Forbidden) error when attempting to render a component. The error message specifically states:

> Unhandled exception rendering component: Response status code does not indicate success: 403 (Forbidden).

This error occurs within the `ReadStickersAsync` method on line 118 of my `Stickers.razor` component, which is called during the `OnInitializedAsync` lifecycle method on line 110.

**Stickers.razor:**

```razor
@page ""/stickers""

    {

    private async Task ReadStickersAsync(int pageNumber, int pageSize)
    {
        // ... code to make API request ... // Line 118
    }
}
```

I've verified that the API endpoint I'm calling requires authentication, and I'm handling authentication using JWT tokens. The token is included in the request headers.

**What I've tried:**

* Double-checked the API endpoint URL and request method.
* Confirmed that the JWT token is valid and being sent in the request headers.
* Tested the API endpoint independently and it returns the expected data when accessed with a valid token.

I'm unsure why I'm still receiving a 403 (Forbidden) error despite seemingly correct authentication. Any help in resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated."

Its using store and zustand. I was trying to work it out for days and AI involved but i cant solve the problem. The usernames on the Gangs page not shown neither roles(promote-demote stuff). Its bigger than project now. It was on file so i seperated but its still same. If required/wanted i can share my zustand/store too.
If any editor readings this for approval i kindly ask for optimization for this question. Im really cozy head right now. Would you please help me to improve my question and make it more clear ? Is it too complex or not enough sharing ? I dont think its backend related because i see the names before and backend is simple and on console.log i can print.

I'm having trouble with an array of objects in my React project. The array itself seems to have the correct length, but the objects inside are all showing as `{username: undefined, role: undefined}`.

Here's the relevant code:

```javascript
// Gangs.js:89
console.log(userGang); 
// Output: {id: 31, name: 'elton john', leader_id: 25, user_id: 25, members: Array(2), ...}

console.log(userGang.members);
// Output: (2) [{...}, {...}]

// Gangs.js:90
console.log(userGang.members);
// Output: (2) [{username: undefined, role: undefined}, {username: undefined, role: undefined}]
```

As you can see, the `userGang` object seems to be structured correctly and the `members` array has the expected length of 2. However, when I try to access the individual objects within the `members` array, their properties (`username` and `role`) are all `undefined`.

**Expected behavior:**

I expect the `members` array to contain objects with defined values for `username` and `role`.

**Actual behavior:**

The `members` array contains objects with `undefined` values for `username` and `role`.

I've double-checked that the data being used to populate these objects is correct. What could be causing this issue and how can I fix it?"

",['https://i.sstatic.net/EDy3Vp5Z.png'],Why does using a subquery in SELECT statement cause higher query cost compared to direct table selection?,"## Why does a subquery increase the cost of this simple SELECT statement?

I have two nearly identical SQL queries in SQL Server. The first uses a subquery, while the second selects directly from the table. Both queries have the same WHERE clause.

**Query 1 (with subquery):**

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM (SELECT * FROM Movie.Genre) AS [e]

```sql

The execution plan shows that Query 1 has a cost of 100%, while Query 2 has a cost of 0%. Both queries perform a Clustered Index Scan on the same index.

**Expected Behavior:**

I would expect both queries to have the same execution plan and cost since they are logically equivalent.

**Actual Behavior:**

The query with the subquery has a significantly higher cost.

**Question:**

Why does the subquery affect the query cost in this case? Is there a way to rewrite the query with the subquery to achieve the same performance as the direct select?"

My question is that so does the Roboelectric fall into the Instrumented test (which belong to the AndroidTest folder) or the unitTest, because it seems I can't run the test because it hang indefinately.

Also my other question, is how to setup your physical device for instrument and end to end testing efficiently. In many cases, you need to install the app, activate the Display pop up windows while running background for each app and run the testing. Does there any alternative way of doing the instrument / end to end testing in the physical device?

I am having an issue with the `createTime` field in my JSON response.  No matter what time is set in the request, the response always shows `""createTime"":""12:00:00""`.

**Request:**

```json

The `createTime` field always defaults to `12:00:00` regardless of the request data.

79130607,Why does the Bulma CSS framwork change the z-index on hover?,"I am looking into rendering performance issues of my website and I have found that I get a lot of repaints while just moving the mouse pointer around.
Example: the HTML-Box below the input field and button get a repaint each time I move the mouse pointer (hovering only) between the input and the button in this page (from the official Bulma docs)

I am using the Bulma CSS framework with an ""add-on""-arrangement on some elements. A deeper analysis has show that such buttons and inputs have their z-index changed on hover. The relevant scss code in Bulma is this:
From tools.scss:
  .#{iv.$class-prefix}button,
  .#{iv.$class-prefix}input,
  .#{iv.$class-prefix}select select {
    &:not([disabled]) {
      &:hover,
      &.#{iv.$class-prefix}is-hovered {
        z-index: 2;
      }

      &:focus,
      &.#{iv.$class-prefix}is-focused,
      &:active,
      &.#{iv.$class-prefix}is-active {
        z-index: 3;

        &:hover {
          z-index: 4;
        }
      }
    }
  }

What is the logic behind such a z-index change on hover?
It's causing a ton of repaints on my quite complex website. Do other CSS frameworks have a similar function? I am tempted to remove/neuter these z-index changes.
",['https://i.sstatic.net/ykeZwCx0.png'],How to align a button next to an input field using Bulma CSS?,"## Button not aligned with input field in Bulma CSS

I'm trying to create a simple search bar using Bulma CSS, but the search button is not aligning properly with the input field. It appears below the input field instead of being on the same line.

Here's my HTML code:

```html
<div class=""field has-addons"">
  <div class=""control"">
    <input class=""input"" type=""text"" placeholder=""Find a repository"">
  </div>
  <div class=""control"">
    <button class=""button is-info"">
      Search

  </div>
</div>
```

**Expected behavior:** The ""Search"" button should be on the same line and to the right of the input field, creating a single-line search bar.

**Actual behavior:** The button is placed on a new line below the input field.

I've checked the Bulma documentation and tried different combinations of classes, but I can't seem to get the desired alignment. What am I missing?"
79130529,Adding a new package broke my Spring Boot Application,"I'm getting troubles since I have added a new package in my spring boot application containing Mapstructs' mappers. Looks like the field:
@Autowired    
private UtenteMapper utenteMapper; 

is not being populated in my Service component. The Spring boot main class, PaniECumpanagghiuApplicationConfiguration, is quite essential, (it contains only the @SpringBootApplicationAnnotation annotation), but I've tried previously to add a @ComponentScan.
@SpringBootApplication    
@ComponentScan(""PaniECumpanagghiu.PaniECumpanagghiu.Mappers"")

In this way the functionality is being recovered, but the @Controller is not fired (when I invoke my API the server retrieves 404). I tried also to add all the packages into the annotation @ComponentScan, like this
@ComponentScan(""PaniECumpanagghiu.PaniECumpanagghiu.Mappers"",""PaniECumpanagghiu.PaniECumpanagghiu.controller"",...)
In this way neither the former object, UtenteMapper, is populated anymore (same behavior than the case without @ComponentScan annotation).
If I comment all references to the new package, and I simplify the API in order to return only a String (""Ciao""), the controller is fired. This is my tree directory

I have described everything in the previous section.

I have a simple Spring Boot application that I'm trying to run in Eclipse. The application starts up without any errors in the console, but I'm not seeing any of my beans getting created. I've verified that the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is present and in the correct location.

Here's my main application class:

		SpringApplication.run(PaniECumpanagghiuApplication.class, args);
	}

}
```

**Expected Behavior:**

I expect to see log messages indicating that my Spring beans are being created when the application starts.

**Actual Behavior:**

The application starts up without any errors, but there are no log messages related to bean creation.

**What I've Tried:**

* I have double-checked that all my dependencies are correctly added to the `pom.xml` file.
* I have tried cleaning and rebuilding the project.
* I have restarted Eclipse.

79130391,ShadCN UI and Radix UI Conflict in Vercel Commerce Template After Next.js 15 Update,"I'm facing an issue using ShadCN UI with the Vercel Commerce template after it was updated to Next.js 15. ShadCN UI components worked without issues in the previous version, but now they throw a module resolution error related to Radix UI when imported
Here’s the error I get when I try to use ShadCN UI’s DropdownMenu component:
Module not found: Can't resolve '@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu'
Steps to Reproduce
Clone the latest Vercel Commerce template (Next.js 15).
Install ShadCN UI following the official documentation.
Import and try to use any ShadCN UI component, such as DropdownMenu.
The error appears, preventing the app from compiling.
What I’ve Tried
Removing node_modules and pnpm-lock.yaml, then reinstalling dependencies.
Testing ShadCN UI with a simple Next.js 15 project (without Vercel Commerce); it works fine.
Adding @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu directly to package.json, but it didn’t resolve the issue.
Environment

Next.js Version: 15.0.0-rc.1
Package Manager: pnpm
Vercel Commerce Template: Latest version after Next.js 15 update

Expected Behavior
ShadCN UI should work as expected with the Vercel Commerce template, just like it did with the previous version of Next.js
Question
Is this a known compatibility issue between Radix UI in ShadCN and Vercel Commerce’s dependency versions? If so, are there any workarounds, or will I need to modify dependencies manually to get these components working together?
Additional Info
I’ve noticed that Radix UI components are deeply embedded in ShadCN, which may be causing version conflicts in the Vercel Commerce template. Any guidance on resolving this conflict would be helpful

**Expected Behavior:**

I expect the build process to complete successfully, recognizing the installed `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu` package.

**Actual Behavior:**

The build fails with the ""Module not found"" error mentioned above.

**Steps I've Taken:**

* I've verified that the `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu` package is installed in my `node_modules` directory.
* I've tried clearing the cache and reinstalling the package.
* I've checked for any typos in the import path.

Here is the relevant code:

I have checked that `model_fields` is a dictionary and that the key `k` exists. I am not sure why `Foo.model_fields[k]` is returning `None`.

**Expected behavior:**

I expect `Foo.model_fields[k]` to return a `FieldInfo` object, which should have the `json_schema_extra` attribute.

**Actual behavior:**

`Foo.model_fields[k]` is returning `None`, which is causing the `TypeError`.

Here's my test class:

```java
package main;

import org.junit.rules.ExpectedException;
import org.junit.Test;

public class Test {

    @org.junit.Rule
    public ExpectedException thrown = ExpectedException.none();

I've tried three different approaches:

1. **`@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)`:** This approach doesn't seem to catch the exception at all.
2. **`thrown.expect()`:** This approach also fails to catch the exception.
3. **`try-catch` block:** This approach successfully catches the exception and verifies the error message.

**Expected behavior:**

I expect the tests using `@Test(expected = ...)` and `thrown.expect()` to pass, as the `SampleClass` constructor should throw an `IllegalArgumentException` for the invalid input.

**Actual behavior:**

The tests using JUnit's exception handling mechanisms are failing, while the `try-catch` block works as expected.

What am I doing wrong with the JUnit exception handling? Why aren't the first two approaches catching the exception?"

I'm trying to deserialize a JSON string into a C# object using Newtonsoft.Json. The deserialization seems to work, but the `Items` property of my object is always null.

Here's my code:

```C#
// jsonContent contains a valid JSON string
string jsonContent = ""{ \""items\"": [ { \""q\"": { \""id\"": null, \""weight\"": 0, \""name\"": \""Original Search\"", \""originalSearch\"": true, \""value\"": \""murder\"" }, \""dWim\"": true, \""qLang\"": \""NaturalAnd\"", \""parseAlgori... }"";

    // ... other properties
}

public class Item 
{
    public string q { get; set; }

I've verified that `jsonContent` contains a valid JSON string with a non-null `items` array. I've also tried using `[JsonProperty(""items"")]` on the `Items` property, but it didn't help.

**Expected behavior:**

The `search.Items` property should contain a list of `Item` objects.

79126371,Override (reintroduce) property with typescript declaration merging,"The base/built-in declaration of Event and GlobalEventHandlersEventMap looks like so:
// lib.dom.d.ts

interface Event {
    /**
     * Returns the type of event, e.g. ""click"", ""hashchange"", or ""submit"".
     */
    readonly type: string;   // <-- note this part
}

interface GlobalEventHandlersEventMap {
    click: MouseEvent;
    //... all sorts of other built in events...

Let's say I define an EventTriggered whose constructor has a parameter containing one of the properties named in GlobalEventHandlersEventMap:
class EventTriggered {
    constructor(
        readonly eventName: keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap
    ) {}
}

This means that the following works because there is a property named 'click':
new EventTriggered('click');

But the following will not work (this is ok and intended):
new EventTriggered('some-random-string');

Now I want to use this class inside an event listener, like so:
function onClick(event: Event): void {
    new EventTriggered(event.type);
}

This will fail because as in the first example, event.type contains ""any string"". Type casting could be one way of solving this:
function onClick(event: Event): void {
    new EventTriggered(event.type as keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap);
}

BUT in my opinion, the original declaration of type is wrong - it should not be string, but keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap.
I tried doing that with declaration merging:
// global.d.ts
interface Event {
    readonly type: keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap;
}

Here's the relevant code snippet:

```typescript
someElement.addEventListener('click', (e) => {

The IDE suggests two possible types for `e.type`:

1. `keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap`
2. `string`

**Expected Behavior:**

I expect `e.type` to be recognized as a `string` representing the event type (e.g., 'click', 'mouseover').

**Actual Behavior:**

I'm getting a type error related to the conflicting types. It seems like TypeScript is unsure whether to infer the type as a specific event type from `GlobalEventHandlersEventMap` or a general `string`.

**Question:**

How can I resolve this type conflict and ensure that `e.type` is correctly inferred as a `string`?"

79122871,Dynamic Configuration of Facebook Login with react-native-fbsdk-next in Expo,"I am using react-native-fbsdk-next with Expo to implement Facebook login. In order to configure this, I need to include certain settings in app.config.ts, as shown in the image below:

However, I want to avoid hardcoding these values directly in the configuration file. Instead of using environment variables, I would like to fetch these configurations dynamically from an API, allowing me to update them whenever necessary. Since app.config.ts is generated only at build time, is there a way to pass these configurations dynamically?
I came across a potential solution
  const setFBSDKSecrets = async () => {
      const res: SSOType = await API('/auth/get-credentials', {
        method: 'GET',
      })

      Settings.setAppID(res.facebook.clientId)
      Settings.setClientToken(res.facebook.clientToken)
      Settings.setAppName('myApp')
      Settings.setAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled(false)
      Settings.setAutoLogAppEventsEnabled(false)
    }

    setFBSDKSecrets()

I implemented this by adding the settings there and removing them from app.config.ts. However, when I ran yarn start, I encountered an error stating that the appID is missing:
Error: missing appID in the plugin properties

Can anyone provide solution on how to resolve this issue or suggest a better approach for dynamically configuring Facebook login settings in Expo?
",['https://i.sstatic.net/G0MsWnQE.png'],React Native FBSDK: How to Configure `iosUserTrackingPermission` for Personalized Ads?,"## React Native FBSDK: iosUserTrackingPermission string instead of boolean

I'm trying to configure `react-native-fbsdk-next` in my React Native project and I'm facing an issue with the `iosUserTrackingPermission` setting. 

Here's my `expo.plugins` configuration in `app.json`:

```json
{
  ""expo"": {
    ""plugins"": [
      [
        ""react-native-fbsdk-next"",
        {
          ""appID"": ""48127127xxxxxxxx"",

          ""advertiserIDCollectionEnabled"": false,
          ""autoLogAppEventsEnabled"": false,
          ""isAutoInitEnabled"": true,
          ""iosUserTrackingPermission"": ""This identifier will be used to deliver personalized ads to you""
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
}
```

The problem is that the `iosUserTrackingPermission`  is expecting a boolean value (true/false) but I'm getting a string value instead. 

**Expected behavior:** 
The `iosUserTrackingPermission` should accept a boolean value to indicate whether to request user tracking permission.

**Actual behavior:**
The configuration seems to be interpreting the `iosUserTrackingPermission` as a string, and I'm not sure where this string value is even coming from.

How can I fix this configuration and provide the correct boolean value for `iosUserTrackingPermission`?"

79121996,VIM snippet (UltiSnips): pad line until column 80 reached with a character,"The code I often work at has a comment style like
#---------------------------------------------
# this is a comment
#---------------------------------------------
this.is_code()

I wanted to write a VIM snippet (using UltiSnips) that pads the comment box up until column number 80 (or better until vims colorcolumn). It should take the indentation level into account and always fill the dashes up until column 80.
I have a working snippet present that looks like this
snippet #
#`!p snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
# $1
#`!p snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
$0
endsnippet

Problem here is that when I start typing the number of dashes moves back. Because while I enter a comment the cursor I use in the snipept moves.
I think I need a pyhton or VIM variable that holdes the lines column from which I can subtract 80. But I can't find anything that works for this case.
Edit:
I've found one possible solution to avoid the moving dashes in the template by checking snip.c By checking for emptyness I can make sure that interpolation is done only once.
snippet #
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
# $1
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
$0
endsnippet

Unfortunately since I still have not found a replacement for using the current cursor position vim.current.window.cursor I get wrong lengths for snippets that have comments in indented blocks. For example:
snippet if
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
# if comment
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
IF( $1 )
   #`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
   # inside if
   #`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
   $0

The generated swagger entry point looks like this now:

Where all the inner classes of my main class are represented by strings. If we just take a look at the first Property (IDFactura), this is the code generated by wsdltophp
     /**
     * The IDFactura
     * @var \App\Application\ServiceReferences\Verifactu\StructType\IDFacturaExpedidaType|null
     * @OA\Property()
     */
    protected ?\App\Application\ServiceReferences\Verifactu\StructType\IDFacturaExpedidaType $IDFactura = null;

(The @OA\Schema is also generated by wsdltophp) But it's clear that my SwaggerUI is representing this inner class like a simple string.
Since this WSDL is external and I have no control over it, nor the wsdltophp generated code, I'm looking for a solution which would avoid updating/modifying those external classes

The error message seems to indicate that the script chrome-extension://5216f022-cd78-49fc-abf9-9e362fc1640f/assets/content-script-preamble.js.js is being blocked due to a violation of the CSP. However, I haven’t made any changes to the manifest or the code recently.
Some additional context:

The extension uses Vite and React.
The error started appearing suddenly, and the extension was working fine previously.
I am not explicitly loading any external scripts apart from the ones within the extension.
My CSP currently allows 'self' and 'wasm-unsafe-eval' under script-src.
I've tried to debug this but can’t seem to pinpoint what might be causing this issue.

My questions:

What might be the cause of this error if nothing has changed in my extension?
How can I resolve the CSP issue to allow the script to load properly?
Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

",['https://i.sstatic.net/DdBchBy4.png'],Flutter Firebase Storage Image URL Returning Null for Some Images,"## Flutter: Image URL is null when building a meal card

I am building a Flutter app that displays meal cards with images fetched from Firebase Storage. The meal data, including the image URLs, is stored in a list of maps.

**Problem:**

While iterating through the list and building the meal cards, the image URL for some meals is `null`, even though the URL exists in the original meal data.

**Console Output:**

flutter: Building meal card for: Salmon

flutter: Meal saved successfully
```

As you can see, the first meal (Cereal) has the correct image URL, but the second meal (Salmon) shows `null` for the `imageUrl` when building the card, even though the initial meal data contains the URL.

**Expected Behavior:**

The image URL should be consistent throughout the process of building the meal cards.

**Actual Behavior:**

The image URL becomes `null` for some meals when building the cards.

**Question:**

What could be causing the image URL to become `null` during the card building process, and how can I fix this issue?"

I'm getting a TypeScript error in my Svelte component where I'm trying to dynamically set the `src` attribute of an `<img>` tag. The error message says:

</script>

<img src={srcFile} class=""contained_photo"" alt=""alt"" />
```

I'm using `$props()` to access a prop called `srcFile` which should contain the image URL. I'm not sure why TypeScript is inferring the type of `srcFile` as `unknown`.

TypeScript should recognize that the `src` attribute of an `<img>` tag can accept a string, null, or undefined value, and it should not throw an error.

**Actual behavior:**

TypeScript is throwing an error saying that `unknown` is not assignable to `string | null | undefined`.

I have defined the `--left-menu-width` variable in my global CSS file:

```css
html {
  --left-menu-width: 40px;
}
```

I have also tried setting the width directly in the component's CSS file, but that did not work either:

```css
:host {
  width: 40px;
}
```

The component is displayed correctly in the browser's developer tools, but the width is not being applied.

**Expected behavior:**

The component should have a width of 40px.

**Actual behavior:**

The component is taking up the full width of the screen.

**Things I've checked:**

- I don't have any explicit server/client branching logic using `typeof window !== 'undefined'`.
- I'm not using `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` directly in my component rendering logic.
- I've reviewed my date formatting and locale settings to ensure consistency between the server and client.
- I'm not manipulating the DOM directly outside of React's lifecycle methods.
- I've disabled browser extensions to rule out any interference.

I'm unsure what's causing the mismatch between the server-rendered HTML and the client-side rendering. Any help in identifying the root cause of this issue would be greatly appreciated."

",['https://i.sstatic.net/pBdrFujf.png'],"Java Swing Calculator - How to Handle Invalid User Input (e.g., Non-Numeric, Empty) in JOptionPane?","## Java Swing Calculator - ""Error - invalid input!"" on Summation

I'm building a simple calculator application in Java Swing that includes a summation feature. The user is prompted to enter the start value, end value, and the expression to be evaluated. However, when I run the code and click the summation button, I consistently get an ""Error - invalid input!"" message displayed in the text field, regardless of the input values.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

```java
public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
    if (e.getSource() == summationButton) { 
        try {
            String startInput = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(parentComponent: null, message: ""Enter start value"");
            String endInput = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(parentComponent: null, message: ""Enter end value"");

            if (startInput != null && !startInput.isEmpty() && endInput != null && !endInput.isEmpty()) {
                int start = Integer.parseInt(startInput);
                int end = Integer.parseInt(endInput);

                if (start > end) {
                    textfield.setText(""Error - start value must be equal to the end value."");
                    return;
                }

                String expressionInput = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(parentComponent: null, message: ""Enter expression:"");

                if (expressionInput != null && !expressionInput.isEmpty()) {
                    double summationResult = 0;
                    for (int x = start; x <= end; x++) {
                        double value = evaluatePolynomial(expressionInput, x);
                        summationResult += value;
                    }
                    textfield.setText(""Σ ("" + expressionInput + "") from "" + start + "" to "" + end + "" = "" + summationResult);
                } else {
                    textfield.setText(""Error - invalid expression!""); 
                }
            } else {
                textfield.setText(""Error - invalid range!"");
            }
        } catch (NumberFormatException ex) {
            // Handle NumberFormatException
        }
    }
}
```

I've tested various inputs, including valid expressions and ranges, but the error persists. I suspect the issue might be related to how I'm handling user input or the `evaluatePolynomial` method (not shown here), but I haven't been able to pinpoint the exact cause.

**Expected Behavior:**

The calculator should correctly evaluate the summation of the given expression within the specified range and display the result in the text field.

**Actual Behavior:**

The calculator displays ""Error - invalid input!"" regardless of the input values.

Could someone please help me identify the source of this error and suggest a solution?"

However, it is failing on the call of the constructFunc, throwing an error at the following code in boost/dll/import.hpp:

Why is this failing? The type of std::string.c_str() is const char*, so it seems like it is the correct type.

79089650,Laravel Broadcasting not firing on the Job Queue,"I am creating a AI ChatBot. The message is entered on the frontend (Livewire) and then stored in the database. A model ""created"" listener then pushes a job onto the queue which asks the AI (LLM) the prompt and the answer is then updated on the model (on the queue). There is then an ""updated"" listener, which fires a broadcasting event.
On the front end the Livewire component is listening via Laravel Echo for the updated event, and the chat response is shown to the user.
The problem I have is that the broadcasting event works, but not on the queue. I have tested it via a Console Command and it updates the chat, but when the job is processed on the queue, no update occurs.
I have checked the Herd logs, and again, I can see the event broadcasting when I manually trigger with the Console Command, but no event is broadcasted when the job is processed on the queue.
So:

The job to get the llm response is always successfully processed on the queue when the model is created
The LlmMessage model is always updated successfully by this job, and the response is stored
The LlmMessageUpdated event is broadcasted and the Livewire Component updated when a manual update is triggered
The LlmMessageUpdated event is not broadcasted and the Livewire Component is not updated when the job updates the model

As you can see, the client successfully connects and subscribes to the ""1lm-thread-1"" channel. However, the connection is immediately closed afterward. 

**Expected behavior:** The client should remain connected to the channel and receive real-time updates.

**Actual behavior:** The client connects briefly, subscribes, and then the connection closes.

I've verified that my Pusher credentials are correct and that the channel name is consistent between my client-side and server-side code.

I'm working on a Flutter project using the `drift` package for database management. I've defined my database schema and used the drift generator to create the corresponding Dart code.

However, when I try to use the generated `AddTodoProvider` class, I get an ""Undefined class 'InvalidType'"" error. This error appears on the line where I pass a `todo` argument to the `call` method of the provider.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

```dart

///
/// Copied from [addTodo].
AddTodoProvider call(
  InvalidType todo, // Error: Undefined class 'InvalidType'
) {
  return A
  todo,
  );
}
```

I've checked the generated code, and I can't find any reference to a class named `InvalidType`. I've also tried cleaning and rebuilding the project, but the error persists.

**Expected behavior:**

The code should compile without errors, as the `AddTodoProvider` and its methods are generated by drift based on my database schema.

**Actual behavior:**

I'm getting an ""Undefined class 'InvalidType'"" error, even though this class doesn't seem to be used anywhere in my code.

I'm trying to use the `INDEX` function in Excel to dynamically retrieve values from a list in column R, based on whether corresponding cells in column P are empty. However, I'm getting a `#VALUE!` error for most of the results, and a `#SPILL!` error at the end.

```excel

**Expected Behavior:**

The formula should check if cell P2 is empty. If it's not empty, it should return the value from P2. If P2 is empty, it should return a value from column R. The `INDEX` function should find the correct row by subtracting the count of non-empty cells in the range `P2:P5000` from the current row number.

For example:

* T2 should return ""Net Sales Revenue"" (from P2)
* T3 should return ""Other Operating Proceeds"" (from P3)
* T4 should return ""General and Administrative Expenses"" (from R2)
* T5 should return ""Income Taxes"" (from R3)

Instead, I'm getting:

* T4 to T13 return `#VALUE!` errors.

As you can see, within the definition of `""additionalProperties""`, I'm again defining `""additionalProperties""`. This seems to be causing an issue, likely leading to infinite recursion. 

**Expected Behavior:** I want to allow any additional properties within the `""additionalProperties""` object.

**Actual Behavior:** I'm encountering errors (mention specific errors if any) related to the schema definition, and I suspect this recursive structure is the culprit.

How can I correctly define `""additionalProperties""` within my schema without running into this recursion problem?"
79079438,Get VSCode to recognize aliases,"Ok, so I built an app with Vite and React. I added some aliases to make things easier to read, it works, but VSC is dumb and doesn't pick up on the aliases, which also means it has trouble inferring types and so on.
It's especially dumb since, for instance, @store gets highlighted as being a problem, but @store/index works perfectly. What am I doing wrong here?!
/* vite.config.ts */

      ""@core"": path.resolve(__dirname, ""./src/core""),
      ""@store"": path.resolve(__dirname, ""./src/core/store""),
      ""@user"": path.resolve(__dirname, ""./src/user""),
    },
  },
});

/* tsconfig.app.json */ 

{
  ""compilerOptions"": {
    ""target"": ""ES2020"",
    ""useDefineForClassFields"": true,
    ""lib"": [""ES2020"", ""DOM"", ""DOM.Iterable""],

      ""@user/*"": [""user/*""]
    }
  },

Again, it works, it does compile and run, and I didn't even have to add the aliases to the tsconfig file - which makes sense, I hate having to add it to 2 separate places anyway. But VSCode is still being dumb...

The error seems to originate from within the `useChart.js` library itself, specifically in the `processConfig` function. I've tried searching for solutions online, but haven't found anything that directly addresses this issue.

**Actual behavior:** The app crashes with the ""Maximum call stack size exceeded"" error.

The Issue:
This pipeline does not trigger automatically when a commit is pushed to Repo B on either develop or master. I cannot use checkout because it only accepts self or none. However, Repo B is successfully cloned, and the pipeline runs fine if I trigger it manually
Additional Considerations:

Build services have ""Read and Contribute"" permissions set to ""Allow"" in both repositories.
Both Repo A and Repo B are part of the same project.
The Personal Access Token (PAT) is correctly configured, and the pipeline passes when executed manually.


Question:
Why is the pipeline not triggering automatically, and how can I ensure it runs whenever a commit is pushed to Repo B?
Update
I have read many posts warning about compiling the YAML file in the default branch. I am compiling it in master, which is my default branch, and still doesn't work
Many thanks in advance!

When I researched this problem, the solution says if you are using a nullable command you need to use a length like this: @Column(nullable = false, length = 4096) and this does not solve my problem.
Wrong but If I can't solve I'm gonna add a Soft Delete endpoint with PUT annotation and just update is_deleted part to true.
Thank you for your help!
Edit: When I delete these lines problem is solved but delete is not soft anymore:
@SQLDelete(sql = ""UPDATE permission SET is_deleted = true WHERE id=?"")
@Where(clause = ""is_deleted=false"")

",['https://i.sstatic.net/FyOBqpDV.png'],Spring Boot DataIntegrityViolationException When Deleting Permission: Could not delete: SQL [UPDATE permission SET is_deleted = true WHERE id=?],"## Spring Boot DELETE request throws DataIntegrityViolationException: could not delete

I'm working on a Spring Boot application and I'm having trouble deleting an entity. When I send a DELETE request to `/api/v1/permission/{id}`, I get a 500 Internal Server Error with the following stack trace:

```
org.springframework.dao.DataIntegrityViolationException: could not delete: [com.cloud.atlas.domain.Permission#100]; SQL [UPDATE permission SET is_deleted = true WHERE id=?];
nested exception is org.hibernate.exception.DataException: could not delete: [com.cloud.atlas.domain.Permission#100]
...
```

It seems like a database constraint is preventing the deletion. However, I've checked my database schema and I can't find any foreign key constraints referencing the `Permission` table. 

**Here's what I've tried:**

* I've verified that the `id` exists in the database.
* I've checked for any cascading constraints on the `Permission` entity.
* I've tried manually deleting the entity through a SQL client, but I get the same error.

**Here's the relevant code:**

* **Controller:**

```java
@DeleteMapping(""/{id}"")
public ResponseEntity<Void> deletePermission(@PathVariable Long id) {
    permissionService.delete(id);
    return ResponseEntity.noContent().build();
}
```

* **Service:**

```java
public void delete(Long id) {
    permissionRepository.deleteById(id);
}
```

* **Repository:**

```java
public interface PermissionRepository extends JpaRepository<Permission, Long> {
}
```

I'm using Spring Boot 2.x and Hibernate. Any ideas on what might be causing this issue and how to resolve it?"

As you can see in the screenshot, my solution 'BlazorApp2' contains two projects:

1. **BlazorApp2:** This seems to be the server-side project with a standard Blazor Server structure.
2. **BlazorApp2.Client:** This is supposed to be my Blazor WASM client project, but it's missing the usual RCL structure. There's no `Shared` folder or any indication of Razor components being shared between the client and server.

I expect to see a separate Razor Class Library project within my solution that houses shared components, models, and other logic used by both the server and client projects.

**Actual Behavior:**

The solution only contains a server-side Blazor project and a client-side project that lacks the typical RCL structure.

Am I missing something obvious here? Is there a different way to structure Blazor WASM projects that I'm not aware of? Any help in understanding this structure or how to fix it would be greatly appreciated."

",['https://i.sstatic.net/pPKxvQfg.png'],Javascript console.log() CSS formatting breaks after a certain length,"## Console log styling breaks after a certain length

I'm trying to style my console logs using `console.log('%c styled text', 'style')`, but the styling seems to break after a certain length. 

Here's my code:

```javascript
const cssHeadField = `border-bottom: 1px solid grey; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;font-weight: 600;font-size: 1.2em; background-color: Orange; color: black;`;
const cssError = `background-color: Red; color: black;`;

console.log(`no formatting at all %c and now head field kicks in and now it stops: %c and now a bunch of text that has no formatting, oop! %can error here%c some more text with no for... %coh, another error!%c`, cssHeadField, """", cssError, """", cssError, """");

console.log(`no formatting at all %c and now head field kicks in and now it stops: %c and now a bunch of text that has no formatting, oop! %can error here, maybe a longer error description too something that would be multiline or something right?%c some more text with no for... %coh, another error! This one is supposed to be long too just to test it out I guess%c`, cssHeadField, """", cssError, """", cssError, """");
```

**Expected behavior:** The styling defined in `cssHeadField` and `cssError` should be applied to the respective parts of the log message, regardless of length.

**Actual behavior:** The styling works for shorter messages, but for longer messages, the styling breaks after a certain point. The rest of the message is displayed without any styling.

Is there a limit on the length of the string or the number of style arguments that can be passed to `console.log`? How can I ensure that the styling is applied consistently to the entire message?"

TypeScript throws the error mentioned above.

It seems like I'm trying to import a module (`middleware.js`) in a Client Component, but it's only allowed in Server Components. However, I'm not sure where this import is happening. 

**Here's what I've tried:**

* I've checked my `convex/` directory for any direct imports of `middleware.js` in Client Components, but I couldn't find any.
* I've tried searching my `node_modules/` for the `server-only` package mentioned in the error message, but I haven't found anything relevant.

**My question is:**

How can I track down where this incorrect import is happening? Are there any tools or techniques for identifying imports within my Convex application? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
79041481,"NestJs/Bull, runs fine locally but does not work in the cloud","I'm facing an issue with implementing a Bull queue in my NestJS application. I'm using PM2 to manage the application and NGINX as a reverse proxy. The job IDs are stored in Redis, but for some reason, everything just stops and the Bull queue doesn't process the jobs as expected.
I've tried the following:
Using both local Redis and cloud Redis (e.g., Redis Cloud).
Verified that Redis is running and accessible.
Ensured that my Bull queues are correctly initialized in NestJS.
Restarting the app with PM2.
However, the issue persists, and jobs in the queue don't seem to get processed consistently. Any ideas or suggestions on what might be causing this?
Tech Stack:

NestJS (using @nestjs/bull)
Bull (v4.x)
PM2 (for process management)
NGINX (for reverse proxy)
Redis (both local and Redis Cloud)

Additional Info:

Redis connection is established successfully.
Jobs get queued but are not processed.
Everything stops after a while, and Bull doesn't seem to be running well.
Thank you for your help!

I'm using the BullModule in my NestJS application and I'm trying to find a clean way to switch between my local Redis instance and my Redis Cloud instance depending on the environment.

Here's my current setup:

```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [
    BullModule.forRoot({
      redis: {
        host: 'redis-xxxx.redis-cloud.com',
        port: 14166,
        password: 'xxxx',
        // host: 'localhost',
        // port: 6379,
      },
    }),
    // ... other modules
  ],
  // ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Currently, I'm commenting and uncommenting the `host` and `port` lines to switch between environments. This is obviously not ideal. 

What's the best practice for configuring different Redis connections based on the environment (development, production, etc.) in a NestJS application using BullModule?"

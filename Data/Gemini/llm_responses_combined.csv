I've decided to use such setup to mimic how the project is built on the CI system.
The project consists of a test executable E (it uses GoogleTest framework) and two static libraries, L1 and L2, having the following dependencies: L1 -> L2; L1, L2 -> E.
It is build using CMake system.
When building for code coverage, at the very beginning of the whole process I append to all targets the following compiler flags (CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS): -g --coverage -fPIC -O0 -fno-elide-constructors
Then, I generate code coverage report using the following command:
-- C:/msys64/mingw64/bin/gcovr.exe --html index.html --html-details -r <PROJECT_ROOT> --object-directory=<BUILD_DIR> --gcov-executable=llvm-cov gcov --merge-mode-functions=merge-use-line-min --exclude-unreachable-branches --exclude-function-lines --exclude-lines-by-pattern '^\s*\}?\s*$'
The first problem I've encountered is that for at least one source file some functions were found on multiple lines in the same file - what makes no sense to me, as e.g. gcovr reported one of such functions to start in L183 and L185, whereas it actually starts in L185 and L183 contains the closing brace of totally different function. I have no clue why I got this error, but managed to bypass it by using --merge-mode-functions=merge-use-line-min flag.
However, the resulting report is garbage. In particular, numerous empty lines as well as lines containing only comments/closing braces are marked as ""not hit"" what makes the output rather not useful.
Note that I've used --exclude-lines-by-pattern '^\s*\}?\s*$' flag, but for some reason it did not filter out the mentioned problematic lines.
Here is an excerpt from the generated report:

What should I do to make the results more accurate? Use different compiler/linker flags? A different coverage tool?
A different toolchain is not so feasible solution, as then I would have to constantly rebuild the whole project to switch between e.g. Clang <-> GCC.
I've tried to add -Xclang -fprofile-instrument=clang compiler flags to all build targets, but then the build process was stuck at linking my test executable E (or the process was slowed down, that I assumed it became staled; instead of completing let's say in 10-20 seconds, it did not finished even after a few minutes).

How to make Spring Boot inject employeeRepository correctly?
>>",['https://i.sstatic.net/fzGmlmh6.png'],**Spring Boot - NullPointerException in Custom Validator when accessing Autowired Repository**,"## Spring Boot @Component with @Autowired Repository throws NullPointerException

I'm working on a Spring Boot project where I'm implementing a custom validator to check for unique email addresses during registration. I've created a `@Component` annotated class `UniqueEmailValidator` that uses an `@Autowired` `EmployeeRepository` to check if an email already exists.

However, when I test the registration process, I get a `NullPointerException` at the line where I call `employeeRepository.existsByEmail(email)`. It seems the `employeeRepository` is not being injected properly and remains `null`.

Here's my code:

**UniqueEmailValidator.java:**

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class UniqueEmailValidator implements ConstraintValidator<UniqueEmail, String> {

    @Autowired
    private EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;

    @Override
    public boolean isValid(String email, ConstraintValidatorContext context) {
        if (email == null || email.isBlank()) {

        }
        var isUniqueEmail = employeeRepository.existsByEmail(email); // NullPointerException here
        return isUniqueEmail;
    }
}
```

**Debugging Information:**

The IDE debugger shows that `employeeRepository` is `null` at the point of the exception.

**Expected Behavior:**

I expect the `employeeRepository` to be properly injected by Spring so I can use it to check for existing emails.

**Actual Behavior:**

A `NullPointerException` is thrown because `employeeRepository` is `null`.

**Question:**

What could be causing this `NullPointerException` and how can I ensure my `EmployeeRepository` is correctly injected into my `UniqueEmailValidator` component?","<<**Spring Boot - NullPointerException in Custom Validator when accessing Autowired Repository**>>

**Debugging Information:**

The IDE debugger shows that `employeeRepository` is `null` at the point of the exception.

**Expected Behavior:**

I expect the `employeeRepository` to be properly injected by Spring so I can use it to check for existing emails.

**Actual Behavior:**

A `NullPointerException` is thrown because `employeeRepository` is `null`.

**Question:**

What could be causing this `NullPointerException` and how can I ensure my `EmployeeRepository` is correctly injected into my `UniqueEmailValidator` component?>>",Injected EmployeeRepository is null in Spring Boot Application,"I am experiencing an issue in my Spring Boot application where the `employeeRepository` field within my `UniqueEmailValidator` class is always evaluating to `null`, even though it is being autowired.

The most important part of the error is the fact that the debugger shows `employeeRepository = null` despite the `@Autowired` annotation. This suggests that the dependency injection is not working as expected.

Could there be a configuration issue or a problem with the way I am using Spring's dependency injection mechanism? Any help in resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated.","<<Injected EmployeeRepository is null in Spring Boot Application>>

I have two users: A and B, A has the permission to access my Restful API developed with ASP.NET Core Web API, B doesn't have the permission to access that API resource (API will return 403)
In my Blazor Web Assembly app, there is a page which will read data from this Restful API, so, I would like when A user logs in, s/he can access this page correctly, but when B logs in, since B doesn't have the access to the API, therefore, when the page is loading and reading data from API, the page will get 403 error and should instead show something like ""You don't have permission to access the page""

So, in the OnInitializedAsync method of the Blazor page, it uses injected IHttpClientFactory to create an HttpClient, and makes a call to the API:
using var httpClient = HttpClientFactory.CreateClient(""stickersHttpClient"");
var httpResponseMessage = await httpClient.GetAsync($""api/stickers?page={pageNumber}&size={pageSize}"");
httpResponseMessage.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
var responseJson = await httpResponseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
PageContent = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<StickersPage>(responseJson);

If it is user B who opens this page, the httpClient.GetAsync will definitely return 403 error, but instead of showing a ""You don't have permission to view this page"" error on the page, the page actually reported an error in the console:

I have already applied @attribute [Authorize] on the page, and in the App.razor it has the following authorized view settings:

I want to use a profile-oriented monitor, but having the sidebar on the side takes up ~1/3 of my screen. It'd be much more economical to have it on the bottom.

Well I know that the purpose of the UnitTest is to run the test faster, I on the later codelab it stated that it's faster to mock / fake the repository and pass it to the viewModel rather than using context and instantiate the viewModel (which remove the AndroidJUnit4 test runner) and remove the roboelectric test that takes ages to run.

My question is that so does the Roboelectric fall into the Instrumented test (which belong to the AndroidTest folder) or the unitTest, because it seems I can't run the test because it hang indefinately.

Also my other question, is how to setup your physical device for instrument and end to end testing efficiently. In many cases, you need to install the app, activate the Display pop up windows while running background for each app and run the testing. Does there any alternative way of doing the instrument / end to end testing in the physical device?


Thanks for reading this. And It will probably my reminder to doing testing in the future

","<<Why are they sometimes inconsistent? value of java.sql.Date type received from server then converted by google.gson .A json string sent from server>>
<<Why are the dates sometimes inconsistent? Value of java.sql.Date type received from client Postman then is deserialized by com.google.gson.Gson (and before instantiating the Gson instance, I register two adapters -- one for deserializing java.sql.Date, another for deserializing java.sql.Time). And a JSON string sent from client.
I try to send a request from Postman to Tomcat v9.0 and deserialized the raw data (here is a JSON string) to DietDiary object which contain two fields with type java.sql.Date and java.sql.Time using com.google.gson package.
Two keys of raw data of request in Postman.
""createDate"":""2022-05-05"",
""createTime"":""12:00:00"", 


But the console in Eclipse prints

I am using the Bulma CSS framework with an ""add-on""-arrangement on some elements. A deeper analysis has show that such buttons and inputs have their z-index changed on hover. The relevant scss code in Bulma is this:

  .#{iv.$class-prefix}select select {
    &:not([disabled]) {
      &:hover,

What is the logic behind such a z-index change on hover?

","<<Why does the Bulma CSS framwork change the z-index on hover?>>
<<I am looking into rendering performance issues of my website and I have found that I get a lot of repaints while just moving the mouse pointer around.
Example: the HTML-Box below the input field and button get a repaint each time I move the mouse pointer (hovering only) between the input and the button in this page (from the official Bulma docs)

I am using the Bulma CSS framework with an ""add-on""-arrangement on some elements. A deeper analysis has show that such buttons and inputs have their z-index changed on hover. The relevant scss code in Bulma is this:
From tools.scss:
  .#{iv.$class-prefix}button,
  .#{iv.$class-prefix}input,
  .#{iv.$class-prefix}select select {
    &:not([disabled]) {
      &:hover,
      &.#{iv.$class-prefix}is-hovered {
        z-index: 2;
      }

      &:focus,
      &.#{iv.$class-prefix}is-focused,
      &:active,
      &.#{iv.$class-prefix}is-active {
        z-index: 3;

        &:hover {
          z-index: 4;
        }
      }
    }
  }

I'm trying to create a simple search bar using Bulma CSS, but the search button is not aligning properly with the input field. It appears below the input field instead of being on the same line.

In this way the functionality is being recovered, but the @Controller is not fired (when I invoke my API the server retrieves 404). I tried also to add all the packages into the annotation @ComponentScan, like this

In this way neither the former object, UtenteMapper, is populated anymore (same behavior than the case without @ComponentScan annotation).

I have a simple Spring Boot application that I'm trying to run in Eclipse. The application starts up without any errors in the console, but I'm not seeing any of my beans getting created. I've verified that the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation is present and in the correct location.

Here's my main application class:

```java
package PaniECumpanagghiu.PaniECumpanagghiu;

import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

		SpringApplication.run(PaniECumpanagghiuApplication.class, args);
	}

}
```

**Expected Behavior:**

I expect to see log messages indicating that my Spring beans are being created when the application starts.

**Actual Behavior:**

The application starts up without any errors, but there are no log messages related to bean creation.

**What I've Tried:**

* I have double-checked that all my dependencies are correctly added to the `pom.xml` file.
* I have tried cleaning and rebuilding the project.
* I have restarted Eclipse.

I'm not sure what else to check. Any help would be greatly appreciated.","<<Spring Boot Application Terminates Immediately After Startup with No Errors in Console - IntelliJ IDEA>>

**Expected Behavior:**

I expect to see log messages indicating that my Spring beans are being created when the application starts.

**Actual Behavior:**

The application starts up without any errors, but there are no log messages related to bean creation.

**What I've Tried:**

* I have double-checked that all my dependencies are correctly added to the `pom.xml` file.
* I have tried cleaning and rebuilding the project.
* I have restarted Eclipse.

79130391,ShadCN UI and Radix UI Conflict in Vercel Commerce Template After Next.js 15 Update,"I'm facing an issue using ShadCN UI with the Vercel Commerce template after it was updated to Next.js 15. ShadCN UI components worked without issues in the previous version, but now they throw a module resolution error related to Radix UI when imported
Here’s the error I get when I try to use ShadCN UI’s DropdownMenu component:
Module not found: Can't resolve '@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu'
Steps to Reproduce
Clone the latest Vercel Commerce template (Next.js 15).
Install ShadCN UI following the official documentation.
Import and try to use any ShadCN UI component, such as DropdownMenu.
The error appears, preventing the app from compiling.
What I’ve Tried
Removing node_modules and pnpm-lock.yaml, then reinstalling dependencies.
Testing ShadCN UI with a simple Next.js 15 project (without Vercel Commerce); it works fine.
Adding @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu directly to package.json, but it didn’t resolve the issue.
Environment

Next.js Version: 15.0.0-rc.1
Package Manager: pnpm
Vercel Commerce Template: Latest version after Next.js 15 update

Expected Behavior
ShadCN UI should work as expected with the Vercel Commerce template, just like it did with the previous version of Next.js
Question
Is this a known compatibility issue between Radix UI in ShadCN and Vercel Commerce’s dependency versions? If so, are there any workarounds, or will I need to modify dependencies manually to get these components working together?
Additional Info
I’ve noticed that Radix UI components are deeply embedded in ShadCN, which may be causing version conflicts in the Vercel Commerce template. Any guidance on resolving this conflict would be helpful

I'm getting a `System.NullReferenceException: 'Object reference not set to an instance of an object.'` error when trying to set the `TopLevel` property of a new form instance in VB.NET. The error message says ""$wo was Nothing.""

Here's the relevant code:

```vb.net

I've tried creating the `Form2` instance outside the `With` block, but the error persists. I'm not sure what `$wo` refers to in the error message.

#---------------------------------------------
# this is a comment
#---------------------------------------------
this.is_code()

I wanted to write a VIM snippet (using UltiSnips) that pads the comment box up until column number 80 (or better until vims colorcolumn). It should take the indentation level into account and always fill the dashes up until column 80.
I have a working snippet present that looks like this
snippet #

# $1
#`!p snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`

Problem here is that when I start typing the number of dashes moves back. Because while I enter a comment the cursor I use in the snipept moves.
I think I need a pyhton or VIM variable that holdes the lines column from which I can subtract 80. But I can't find anything that works for this case.
Edit:
I've found one possible solution to avoid the moving dashes in the template by checking snip.c By checking for emptyness I can make sure that interpolation is done only once.

# $1
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`

Unfortunately since I still have not found a replacement for using the current cursor position vim.current.window.cursor I get wrong lengths for snippets that have comments in indented blocks. For example:

but I am not satisfied with that because in one of Apple WWDC video it was mentioned that if we want exempt item from voice over accessibility don't add it in accessibilityItems and if we want in automation elements just add it.

        }

but I am not satisfied with that because in one of Apple WWDC video it was mentioned that if we want exempt item from voice over accessibility don't add it in accessibilityItems and if we want in automation elements just add it.

According to this it should be

Also I'm using nvm-windows to manage my node versions. node -v and nvm -v won't run on linux but npm -v does. See image below: (It runs normally on cmd)

Can anyone help to explain. To my knowledge both windows and linux should run inside wsl.

I'm trying to install nvm (Node Version Manager) on my Ubuntu system. I followed the instructions on the official GitHub repository, but after installing, I'm unable to run `nvm`, `node`, or `npm`.

Here's what I did:

1. I ran the curl command from the nvm GitHub page.
2. I closed and reopened my terminal.
3. I tried running `nvm -v`, `node -v`, and `npm -v`.

I expect to see the installed versions of nvm, Node.js, and npm.

Some additional context:

The extension uses Vite and React.
The error started appearing suddenly, and the extension was working fine previously.
I am not explicitly loading any external scripts apart from the ones within the extension.
My CSP currently allows 'self' and 'wasm-unsafe-eval' under script-src.
I've tried to debug this but can’t seem to pinpoint what might be causing this issue.

My questions:

What might be the cause of this error if nothing has changed in my extension?
How can I resolve the CSP issue to allow the script to load properly?
Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

The error message seems to indicate that the script chrome-extension://5216f022-cd78-49fc-abf9-9e362fc1640f/assets/content-script-preamble.js.js is being blocked due to a violation of the CSP. However, I haven’t made any changes to the manifest or the code recently.
Some additional context:

The extension uses Vite and React.
The error started appearing suddenly, and the extension was working fine previously.
I am not explicitly loading any external scripts apart from the ones within the extension.
My CSP currently allows 'self' and 'wasm-unsafe-eval' under script-src.
I've tried to debug this but can’t seem to pinpoint what might be causing this issue.

My questions:

What might be the cause of this error if nothing has changed in my extension?
How can I resolve the CSP issue to allow the script to load properly?
Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

I'm developing a Chrome extension and am running into a ""Content Security Policy directive"" error when trying to load a script. The error message is:

```
Refused to load the script 'chrome-extension://8f7f4b16-3e48-4800-8463-f31d5b30ee64/assets/content-script-preamble.js.js' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: ""script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval' 'inline-speculation-rules' http://localhost:* http://127.0.0.1:*"". Note that 'script-src-elem' was not explicitly set, so 'script-src' is used as a fallback.
```

Here's the relevant code snippet where I'm attempting to load the script:

```javascript
(async () => {
  if (""assets/content-script-preamble.js.js"")
    await import(
      /* @vite-ignore */

    );

  await import(
    /* @vite-ignore */
    chrome.runtime.getURL(""node_modules/vite/dist/client/client.mjs.js"")
  );
})();
```

**Expected Behavior:**

I expect the script to load successfully without any CSP errors.

**Actual Behavior:**

The browser throws the CSP error mentioned above, preventing the script from loading.

I'm using Vite as my build tool. I've tried adding `http://localhost:*` and `http://127.0.0.1:*` to the `script-src` directive in my `manifest.json`, but the error persists.

>>",['https://i.sstatic.net/pBdrFujf.png'],"Java Swing Calculator - How to Handle Invalid User Input (e.g., Non-Numeric, Empty) in JOptionPane?","## Java Swing Calculator - ""Error - invalid input!"" on Summation

I'm building a simple calculator application in Java Swing that includes a summation feature. The user is prompted to enter the start value, end value, and the expression to be evaluated. However, when I run the code and click the summation button, I consistently get an ""Error - invalid input!"" message displayed in the text field, regardless of the input values.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

```java
public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
    if (e.getSource() == summationButton) { 
        try {
            String startInput = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(parentComponent: null, message: ""Enter start value"");
            String endInput = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(parentComponent: null, message: ""Enter end value"");

            if (startInput != null && !startInput.isEmpty() && endInput != null && !endInput.isEmpty()) {

79089650,Laravel Broadcasting not firing on the Job Queue,"I am creating a AI ChatBot. The message is entered on the frontend (Livewire) and then stored in the database. A model ""created"" listener then pushes a job onto the queue which asks the AI (LLM) the prompt and the answer is then updated on the model (on the queue). There is then an ""updated"" listener, which fires a broadcasting event.
On the front end the Livewire component is listening via Laravel Echo for the updated event, and the chat response is shown to the user.
The problem I have is that the broadcasting event works, but not on the queue. I have tested it via a Console Command and it updates the chat, but when the job is processed on the queue, no update occurs.
I have checked the Herd logs, and again, I can see the event broadcasting when I manually trigger with the Console Command, but no event is broadcasted when the job is processed on the queue.
So:

The job to get the llm response is always successfully processed on the queue when the model is created
The LlmMessage model is always updated successfully by this job, and the response is stored
The LlmMessageUpdated event is broadcasted and the Livewire Component updated when a manual update is triggered

Laravel Herd Reverb Logs showing event firing when manually triggered:

","<<Laravel Broadcasting not firing on the Job Queue>>
<<I am creating a AI ChatBot. The message is entered on the frontend (Livewire) and then stored in the database. A model ""created"" listener then pushes a job onto the queue which asks the AI (LLM) the prompt and the answer is then updated on the model (on the queue). There is then an ""updated"" listener, which fires a broadcasting event.
On the front end the Livewire component is listening via Laravel Echo for the updated event, and the chat response is shown to the user.
The problem I have is that the broadcasting event works, but not on the queue. I have tested it via a Console Command and it updates the chat, but when the job is processed on the queue, no update occurs.
I have checked the Herd logs, and again, I can see the event broadcasting when I manually trigger with the Console Command, but no event is broadcasted when the job is processed on the queue.
So:

The job to get the llm response is always successfully processed on the queue when the model is created
The LlmMessage model is always updated successfully by this job, and the response is stored
The LlmMessageUpdated event is broadcasted and the Livewire Component updated when a manual update is triggered
The LlmMessageUpdated event is not broadcasted and the Livewire Component is not updated when the job updates the model

Where am I going wrong?

Is there a better way to reference Z in the method signatures?
In my view, what_is_z and listify do not work, because my editor does not list the value of the variable in the following example as list[int] as I would expect. Half the reason of type annotations for me is convenience in the editor (the other half being error checking).

I can see that the 'members' table was created using MySQL Workbench, but no matter how many times I refresh or rerun the code, the 'members' table doesn't contain data like Tony and others.

As you can see, this piece of code doesn’t seem to show any errors, because if there were compilation errors, the 'try' and 'except' should have caught them, but they didn’t.
At the same time, the SQL database still doesn’t have any data like Tony and others.
Since I’m new to this, I’m feeling a bit lost. I really hope I can resolve this issue. In addition to continuing my research, I sincerely ask for your help. Thank you guys.

I have already confirmed that the pymysql.connect command works correctly, and I have used it to create the 'members' table.
import pymysql

conn_test = pymysql.connect(host='localhost', port=3306, user='root', passwd='****', charset='utf8', db='pythonTest')

    );

    cursor.execute(sql_create)

    conn_test.commit()

conn_test.close()

I can see that the 'members' table was created using MySQL Workbench, but no matter how many times I refresh or rerun the code, the 'members' table doesn't contain data like Tony and others.
Since I'm not very familiar with pymysql, I'm not sure where the problem is. Could anyone help me solve this issue?

        print(e);

conn_test.close()


As you can see, this piece of code doesn’t seem to show any errors, because if there were compilation errors, the 'try' and 'except' should have caught them, but they didn’t.
At the same time, the SQL database still doesn’t have any data like Tony and others.
Since I’m new to this, I’m feeling a bit lost. I really hope I can resolve this issue. In addition to continuing my research, I sincerely ask for your help. Thank you guys.

I'm working on a Flutter project using the `drift` package for database management. I've defined my database schema and used the drift generator to create the corresponding Dart code.

However, when I try to use the generated `AddTodoProvider` class, I get an ""Undefined class 'InvalidType'"" error. This error appears on the line where I pass a `todo` argument to the `call` method of the provider.

I'm using `electron-updater` in my Electron app to handle automatic updates. The first time `checkForUpdates()` is called, it works as expected. However, if an update check is already in progress and `checkForUpdates()` is called again, subsequent calls seem to fail silently.

steps:
  - checkout: self

When I researched this problem, the solution says if you are using a nullable command you need to use a length like this: @Column(nullable = false, length = 4096) and this does not solve my problem.
Wrong but If I can't solve I'm gonna add a Soft Delete endpoint with PUT annotation and just update is_deleted part to true.
Thank you for your help!
Edit: When I delete these lines problem is solved but delete is not soft anymore:
@SQLDelete(sql = ""UPDATE permission SET is_deleted = true WHERE id=?"")
@Where(clause = ""is_deleted=false"")

When I researched this problem, the solution says if you are using a nullable command you need to use a length like this: @Column(nullable = false, length = 4096) and this does not solve my problem.
Wrong but If I can't solve I'm gonna add a Soft Delete endpoint with PUT annotation and just update is_deleted part to true.
Thank you for your help!
Edit: When I delete these lines problem is solved but delete is not soft anymore:
@SQLDelete(sql = ""UPDATE permission SET is_deleted = true WHERE id=?"")
@Where(clause = ""is_deleted=false"")

I'm working on a Spring Boot application and I'm having trouble deleting an entity. When I send a DELETE request to `/api/v1/permission/{id}`, I get a 500 Internal Server Error with the following stack trace:

```

It seems like a database constraint is preventing the deletion. However, I've checked my database schema and I can't find any foreign key constraints referencing the `Permission` table. 

**Here's what I've tried:**

* I've verified that the `id` exists in the database.
* I've checked for any cascading constraints on the `Permission` entity.
* I've tried manually deleting the entity through a SQL client, but I get the same error.

**Here's the relevant code:**

* **Controller:**

```java
@DeleteMapping(""/{id}"")
public ResponseEntity<Void> deletePermission(@PathVariable Long id) {
    permissionService.delete(id);
    return ResponseEntity.noContent().build();

<<I am trying to delete a permission with ID 100 via a DELETE request to `/api/v1/permission/{id}` endpoint in my Spring Boot application. However, I am encountering a `DataIntegrityViolationException` with the message ""could not delete: [com.cloud.atlas.domain.Permission#100]; SQL [UPDATE permission SET is_deleted = true WHERE id=?];"".

It seems like there might be a constraint violation preventing the deletion. I have checked the database and confirmed that the permission with ID 100 exists. I have also verified that no other tables have a foreign key constraint referencing this permission.

I am using Spring Boot with Hibernate. Below is the relevant code snippet:

```java
// Service method for deleting permission
@Transactional
public void delete(Long id) {
    permissionRepository.deleteById(id);
}
```

The data that I am trying to fetch in the UserDetails component is based on the following interface:
  export interface IUser {

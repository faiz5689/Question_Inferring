79146412,LINQPad 8 Dump Property Order different that LINQPad 5,"In LINQPad 5 with Linq-to-Sql DataContext, if I dump out a table.
Users.Take( 5 ).Dump();

The results pane has properties in order they were defined in the .dbml file, and thus in the order they were placed in the generated C# class.
In LINQPad 8 with EF Core DbContext objects, if I dump out the same table, the properties are always dumped in alphabetical order vs the order of property declaration in the scaffolded class.
Is there a way to make it dump based on order of declaration?
I saw post about Change order of dump properties which I could maybe implement, but would rather just get a default behavior of order properties appear in class.
Using reflection, if I do typeof( KAT.Camelot.DbContexts.Evolution.AWS.User ).GetProperties().Dump(); the order of the properties listed is in order of declaration.

}) as <E extends ElementType = 'div'>(props: BoxProps<E>) => JSX.Element;

For the handleOnClick callback, I assigned the event in the callback the HTMLElement type from @types/react-dom because it is the parent of all possible HTML dom elements and was generic enough to satisfy TypeScript.
But, I now specifically need access to the event.currentTarget property.

The only way I know of to make TypeScript aware of the currentTarget property is to change HTMLElement to a more specific type, like HTMLButtonElement. But that breaks polymorphism because the developer could pick a tag like ""a"" which means I would need to change the callback event type to HTMLAnchorElement
Is there a generic React Typescript type for HTMLElement that accepts a tag string?  Like HTMLElement<'button'>. I'm just not aware of a generic type that can allow me to set the event conditionally based on an HTML tag name.

79143556,How to get accurate code coverage report using gcovr for MSYS2 MINGW64 Clang project?,"I try to use gcovr tool to obtain code coverage of a C++ project built on Windows using MSYS2 MINGW64's Clang toolchain.
I've decided to use such setup to mimic how the project is built on the CI system.
The project consists of a test executable E (it uses GoogleTest framework) and two static libraries, L1 and L2, having the following dependencies: L1 -> L2; L1, L2 -> E.
It is build using CMake system.
When building for code coverage, at the very beginning of the whole process I append to all targets the following compiler flags (CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS): -g --coverage -fPIC -O0 -fno-elide-constructors
Then, I generate code coverage report using the following command:
-- C:/msys64/mingw64/bin/gcovr.exe --html index.html --html-details -r <PROJECT_ROOT> --object-directory=<BUILD_DIR> --gcov-executable=llvm-cov gcov --merge-mode-functions=merge-use-line-min --exclude-unreachable-branches --exclude-function-lines --exclude-lines-by-pattern '^\s*\}?\s*$'
The first problem I've encountered is that for at least one source file some functions were found on multiple lines in the same file - what makes no sense to me, as e.g. gcovr reported one of such functions to start in L183 and L185, whereas it actually starts in L185 and L183 contains the closing brace of totally different function. I have no clue why I got this error, but managed to bypass it by using --merge-mode-functions=merge-use-line-min flag.
However, the resulting report is garbage. In particular, numerous empty lines as well as lines containing only comments/closing braces are marked as ""not hit"" what makes the output rather not useful.
Note that I've used --exclude-lines-by-pattern '^\s*\}?\s*$' flag, but for some reason it did not filter out the mentioned problematic lines.
Here is an excerpt from the generated report:

What should I do to make the results more accurate? Use different compiler/linker flags? A different coverage tool?
A different toolchain is not so feasible solution, as then I would have to constantly rebuild the whole project to switch between e.g. Clang <-> GCC.
I've tried to add -Xclang -fprofile-instrument=clang compiler flags to all build targets, but then the build process was stuck at linking my test executable E (or the process was slowed down, that I assumed it became staled; instead of completing let's say in 10-20 seconds, it did not finished even after a few minutes). 
[EDIT: It finished after some 15-20 minutes, with a long list of ""undefined reference"" errors occuring for GoogleTest library (libgtest.a) and related to elements of C++ standard library, e.g.:

I attempted to install and reference System.Memory in my .NET 8 project, expecting this to resolve the error thrown by ClosedXML when using the XLWorkbook class.

How to make Spring Boot inject employeeRepository correctly?
",['https://i.sstatic.net/fzGmlmh6.png'],Injected EmployeeRepository is null in Spring Boot Application,"I am experiencing an issue in my Spring Boot application where the `employeeRepository` field within my `UniqueEmailValidator` class is always evaluating to `null`, even though it is being autowired. I have verified that the `EmployeeRepository` interface is correctly annotated and that the application is able to start without any errors.

The most important part of the error is the fact that the debugger shows `employeeRepository = null` despite the `@Autowired` annotation. This suggests that the dependency injection is not working as expected.

Could there be a configuration issue or a problem with the way I am using Spring's dependency injection mechanism? Any help in resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated."
79139703,How can I show an unauthorized view when HttpClient gets 403 from calling API in .NET Blazor Web Assembly?,"Basically here is my scenario that I'm going to achieve:

I have two users: A and B, A has the permission to access my Restful API developed with ASP.NET Core Web API, B doesn't have the permission to access that API resource (API will return 403)
In my Blazor Web Assembly app, there is a page which will read data from this Restful API, so, I would like when A user logs in, s/he can access this page correctly, but when B logs in, since B doesn't have the access to the API, therefore, when the page is loading and reading data from API, the page will get 403 error and should instead show something like ""You don't have permission to access the page""

So, in the OnInitializedAsync method of the Blazor page, it uses injected IHttpClientFactory to create an HttpClient, and makes a call to the API:
using var httpClient = HttpClientFactory.CreateClient(""stickersHttpClient"");
var httpResponseMessage = await httpClient.GetAsync($""api/stickers?page={pageNumber}&size={pageSize}"");
httpResponseMessage.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
var responseJson = await httpResponseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
PageContent = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<StickersPage>(responseJson);

If it is user B who opens this page, the httpClient.GetAsync will definitely return 403 error, but instead of showing a ""You don't have permission to view this page"" error on the page, the page actually reported an error in the console:

I have already applied @attribute [Authorize] on the page, and in the App.razor it has the following authorized view settings:
<CascadingAuthenticationState>
    <Router AppAssembly=""@typeof(App).Assembly"">
        <Found Context=""routeData"">
            <AuthorizeRouteView RouteData=""@routeData"" DefaultLayout=""@typeof(MainLayout)"">
                <NotAuthorized>
                    @if (context.User.Identity?.IsAuthenticated != true)
                    {
                        <RedirectToLogin />
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        <p role=""alert"">You don't have permission to view this page.</p>
                    }
                </NotAuthorized>
            </AuthorizeRouteView>
            <FocusOnNavigate RouteData=""@routeData"" Selector=""h1"" />
        </Found>
        <NotFound>
            <PageTitle>Not found</PageTitle>
            <LayoutView Layout=""@typeof(MainLayout)"">
                <p role=""alert"">Sorry, there's nothing at this address.</p>
            </LayoutView>
        </NotFound>
    </Router>
</CascadingAuthenticationState>

I think there should be some gap between the API and the page, there should be the way allowing my razor page to ""know"" about the 403 returned by the API so that it could apply the routed authentication view. But I don't know how can I do that.
(By the way, the authorization of the user is done against Keycloak with the policy based on user roles)

Well I know that the purpose of the UnitTest is to run the test faster, I on the later codelab it stated that it's faster to mock / fake the repository and pass it to the viewModel rather than using context and instantiate the viewModel (which remove the AndroidJUnit4 test runner) and remove the roboelectric test that takes ages to run.

My question is that so does the Roboelectric fall into the Instrumented test (which belong to the AndroidTest folder) or the unitTest, because it seems I can't run the test because it hang indefinately.

Also my other question, is how to setup your physical device for instrument and end to end testing efficiently. In many cases, you need to install the app, activate the Display pop up windows while running background for each app and run the testing. Does there any alternative way of doing the instrument / end to end testing in the physical device?


Thanks for reading this. And It will probably my reminder to doing testing in the future

The error message indicates that the `ComplexProperty` method is not available for `OwnedNavigationBuilder`. This could be because I am using an incorrect version of Entity Framework Core or because `ComplexProperty` is not the correct method to use in this situation.

Here is the code for my entity class:

```C#
public class MyEntity
{
    // Other properties

    public Dictionary<string, object> Trashed { get; set; }
}
```

How can I resolve this error and create a table with a dictionary property using Entity Framework Core?"
79130670,Why are they sometimes inconsistent? value of java.sql.Date type received from server then converted by google.gson .A json string sent from server,"Why are the dates sometimes inconsistent? Value of java.sql.Date type received from client Postman then is deserialized by com.google.gson.Gson (and before instantiating the Gson instance, I register two adapters -- one for deserializing java.sql.Date, another for deserializing java.sql.Time). And a JSON string sent from client.
I try to send a request from Postman to Tomcat v9.0 and deserialized the raw data (here is a JSON string) to DietDiary object which contain two fields with type java.sql.Date and java.sql.Time using com.google.gson package.
Two keys of raw data of request in Postman.
""createDate"":""2022-05-05"",
""createTime"":""12:00:00"", 


But the console in Eclipse prints

However, I am receiving a `createdDate` with a time that is 4 hours ahead of my current time. I have verified that my system time and the server time are in sync. What could be causing this time discrepancy in the response? 

The most important part of the error is the `createdDate` value which shows a time that is 4 hours ahead `(""createdDate"": ""2022-11-02T05:00:50"")` of the expected time."
79130607,Why does the Bulma CSS framwork change the z-index on hover?,"I am looking into rendering performance issues of my website and I have found that I get a lot of repaints while just moving the mouse pointer around.
Example: the HTML-Box below the input field and button get a repaint each time I move the mouse pointer (hovering only) between the input and the button in this page (from the official Bulma docs)

I am using the Bulma CSS framework with an ""add-on""-arrangement on some elements. A deeper analysis has show that such buttons and inputs have their z-index changed on hover. The relevant scss code in Bulma is this:
From tools.scss:
  .#{iv.$class-prefix}button,
  .#{iv.$class-prefix}input,
  .#{iv.$class-prefix}select select {
    &:not([disabled]) {
      &:hover,
      &.#{iv.$class-prefix}is-hovered {
        z-index: 2;
      }

      &:focus,
      &.#{iv.$class-prefix}is-focused,
      &:active,
      &.#{iv.$class-prefix}is-active {
        z-index: 3;

        &:hover {
          z-index: 4;
        }
      }
    }
  }

What is the logic behind such a z-index change on hover?
It's causing a ton of repaints on my quite complex website. Do other CSS frameworks have a similar function? I am tempted to remove/neuter these z-index changes.

79130529,Adding a new package broke my Spring Boot Application,"I'm getting troubles since I have added a new package in my spring boot application containing Mapstructs' mappers. Looks like the field:
@Autowired    
private UtenteMapper utenteMapper; 

is not being populated in my Service component. The Spring boot main class, PaniECumpanagghiuApplicationConfiguration, is quite essential, (it contains only the @SpringBootApplicationAnnotation annotation), but I've tried previously to add a @ComponentScan.
@SpringBootApplication    
@ComponentScan(""PaniECumpanagghiu.PaniECumpanagghiu.Mappers"")

In this way the functionality is being recovered, but the @Controller is not fired (when I invoke my API the server retrieves 404). I tried also to add all the packages into the annotation @ComponentScan, like this
@ComponentScan(""PaniECumpanagghiu.PaniECumpanagghiu.Mappers"",""PaniECumpanagghiu.PaniECumpanagghiu.controller"",...)
In this way neither the former object, UtenteMapper, is populated anymore (same behavior than the case without @ComponentScan annotation).
If I comment all references to the new package, and I simplify the API in order to return only a String (""Ciao""), the controller is fired. This is my tree directory

I have described everything in the previous section.

79130391,ShadCN UI and Radix UI Conflict in Vercel Commerce Template After Next.js 15 Update,"I'm facing an issue using ShadCN UI with the Vercel Commerce template after it was updated to Next.js 15. ShadCN UI components worked without issues in the previous version, but now they throw a module resolution error related to Radix UI when imported
Here’s the error I get when I try to use ShadCN UI’s DropdownMenu component:
Module not found: Can't resolve '@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu'
Steps to Reproduce
Clone the latest Vercel Commerce template (Next.js 15).
Install ShadCN UI following the official documentation.
Import and try to use any ShadCN UI component, such as DropdownMenu.
The error appears, preventing the app from compiling.
What I’ve Tried
Removing node_modules and pnpm-lock.yaml, then reinstalling dependencies.
Testing ShadCN UI with a simple Next.js 15 project (without Vercel Commerce); it works fine.
Adding @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu directly to package.json, but it didn’t resolve the issue.
Environment

Next.js Version: 15.0.0-rc.1
Package Manager: pnpm
Vercel Commerce Template: Latest version after Next.js 15 update

Expected Behavior
ShadCN UI should work as expected with the Vercel Commerce template, just like it did with the previous version of Next.js
Question
Is this a known compatibility issue between Radix UI in ShadCN and Vercel Commerce’s dependency versions? If so, are there any workarounds, or will I need to modify dependencies manually to get these components working together?
Additional Info
I’ve noticed that Radix UI components are deeply embedded in ShadCN, which may be causing version conflicts in the Vercel Commerce template. Any guidance on resolving this conflict would be helpful

The key piece of information in the screenshot is the highlighted line of code `console.log('Compa LayoutEffectCallback');` within a `useEffect` hook. This log statement is being printed repeatedly to the console, indicating that the effect is being triggered continuously.

I have tried to identify the root cause of this infinite loop, but I am unable to pinpoint the issue. What could be causing this infinite rendering loop in my React component?"
79126371,Override (reintroduce) property with typescript declaration merging,"The base/built-in declaration of Event and GlobalEventHandlersEventMap looks like so:
// lib.dom.d.ts

interface Event {
    /**
     * Returns the type of event, e.g. ""click"", ""hashchange"", or ""submit"".
     */
    readonly type: string;   // <-- note this part
}

interface GlobalEventHandlersEventMap {
    click: MouseEvent;
    //... all sorts of other built in events...
}

Let's say I define an EventTriggered whose constructor has a parameter containing one of the properties named in GlobalEventHandlersEventMap:
class EventTriggered {
    constructor(
        readonly eventName: keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap
    ) {}
}

This means that the following works because there is a property named 'click':
new EventTriggered('click');

But the following will not work (this is ok and intended):
new EventTriggered('some-random-string');

Now I want to use this class inside an event listener, like so:
function onClick(event: Event): void {
    new EventTriggered(event.type);
}

This will fail because as in the first example, event.type contains ""any string"". Type casting could be one way of solving this:
function onClick(event: Event): void {
    new EventTriggered(event.type as keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap);
}

BUT in my opinion, the original declaration of type is wrong - it should not be string, but keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap.
I tried doing that with declaration merging:
// global.d.ts
interface Event {
    readonly type: keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap;
}

What happens then is that the previous error still shows up, but now my IDE shows that type has two declarations:

#---------------------------------------------

I wanted to write a VIM snippet (using UltiSnips) that pads the comment box up until column number 80 (or better until vims colorcolumn). It should take the indentation level into account and always fill the dashes up until column 80.
I have a working snippet present that looks like this
snippet #
#`!p snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
# $1
#`!p snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
$0

Problem here is that when I start typing the number of dashes moves back. Because while I enter a comment the cursor I use in the snipept moves.
I think I need a pyhton or VIM variable that holdes the lines column from which I can subtract 80. But I can't find anything that works for this case.
Edit:
I've found one possible solution to avoid the moving dashes in the template by checking snip.c By checking for emptyness I can make sure that interpolation is done only once.
snippet #
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
# $1
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
$0
endsnippet

Unfortunately since I still have not found a replacement for using the current cursor position vim.current.window.cursor I get wrong lengths for snippets that have comments in indented blocks. For example:
snippet if
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
# if comment
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`

The generated swagger entry point looks like this now:

Where all the inner classes of my main class are represented by strings. If we just take a look at the first Property (IDFactura), this is the code generated by wsdltophp

     * @var \App\Application\ServiceReferences\Verifactu\StructType\IDFacturaExpedidaType|null
     * @OA\Property()

    protected ?\App\Application\ServiceReferences\Verifactu\StructType\IDFacturaExpedidaType $IDFactura = null;

(The @OA\Schema is also generated by wsdltophp) But it's clear that my SwaggerUI is representing this inner class like a simple string.
Since this WSDL is external and I have no control over it, nor the wsdltophp generated code, I'm looking for a solution which would avoid updating/modifying those external classes

Some additional context:

The extension uses Vite and React.
The error started appearing suddenly, and the extension was working fine previously.
I am not explicitly loading any external scripts apart from the ones within the extension.
My CSP currently allows 'self' and 'wasm-unsafe-eval' under script-src.
I've tried to debug this but can’t seem to pinpoint what might be causing this issue.

My questions:

What might be the cause of this error if nothing has changed in my extension?
How can I resolve the CSP issue to allow the script to load properly?
Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

79097264,Correctly tear down process when using pytest with multiprocessing,"I am working on a package that includes a server with the corresponding client.
I was thinking that I could save a lot of effort mocking all the interactions and just write some test cases that test both sides at the same time.

When the tests are done I tear down the process using process.terminate(). Unfortunately there is another ""orphaned"" process that I can't seem to get a handle on.
How do I remove the other process or how do I avoid starting it in the first place?

79089650,Laravel Broadcasting not firing on the Job Queue,"I am creating a AI ChatBot. The message is entered on the frontend (Livewire) and then stored in the database. A model ""created"" listener then pushes a job onto the queue which asks the AI (LLM) the prompt and the answer is then updated on the model (on the queue). There is then an ""updated"" listener, which fires a broadcasting event.
On the front end the Livewire component is listening via Laravel Echo for the updated event, and the chat response is shown to the user.
The problem I have is that the broadcasting event works, but not on the queue. I have tested it via a Console Command and it updates the chat, but when the job is processed on the queue, no update occurs.
I have checked the Herd logs, and again, I can see the event broadcasting when I manually trigger with the Console Command, but no event is broadcasted when the job is processed on the queue.
So:

The job to get the llm response is always successfully processed on the queue when the model is created
The LlmMessage model is always updated successfully by this job, and the response is stored
The LlmMessageUpdated event is broadcasted and the Livewire Component updated when a manual update is triggered

The error message indicates that the maximum call stack size has been reached, suggesting an infinite loop or excessively deep recursion.

The error stack trace points to several locations within the Chart.js component and related files, but it's difficult to pinpoint the exact source of the infinite loop.

How can I debug and resolve this ""Maximum call stack size exceeded"" error in my React Chart.js component? Is there a way to identify the specific code causing the infinite loop or recursion?"

79050210,Azure DevOps. Can't trigger a pipeline in Repo A when a commit is done in repo B,"I’m using Version Dev17.M153.5 (TFS), and I have two repositories: my source code is hosted in Repo B, and my pipelines are hosted in Repo A to keep responsibilities separated.
My goal is for the pipeline in Repo A to automatically run whenever a commit is pushed to Repo B. Below is my current setup:
# MY MAIN PIPELINE IN REPO A:
trigger: none
resources:
  repositories:
    - repository: RepoB
      type: git
      name: Project/RepoB
      ref: develop
      trigger:
        branches:
          include:
            - develop
            - master

pool:
  name: 'Test'

variables:
  REPO_URL: 'https://tfs.company.com/company/Project/_git/RepoB'

steps:
  - task: PowerShell@2
    displayName: 'Configurar encabezado GIT_AUTH_HEADER con PAT'
    inputs:
      targetType: 'inline'
      script: |
        # Crear el encabezado de autenticación en formato Base64
        $headerValue = ""Authorization: Basic "" + [Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes("":"" + $env:PAT))

        git -c http.extraheader=""$headerValue"" clone $(REPO_URL)
    env:
      PAT: $(PAT)  # El PAT como variable de entorno secreta

    #Templates
  - ${{ if eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/master') }}:
    - template: pipeline-master.yml

  - ${{ if eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/develop') }}:
    - template: pipeline-develop.yml

The Issue:
This pipeline does not trigger automatically when a commit is pushed to Repo B on either develop or master. I cannot use checkout because it only accepts self or none. However, Repo B is successfully cloned, and the pipeline runs fine if I trigger it manually
Additional Considerations:

Build services have ""Read and Contribute"" permissions set to ""Allow"" in both repositories.
Both Repo A and Repo B are part of the same project.
The Personal Access Token (PAT) is correctly configured, and the pipeline passes when executed manually.


Question:
Why is the pipeline not triggering automatically, and how can I ensure it runs whenever a commit is pushed to Repo B?
Update
I have read many posts warning about compiling the YAML file in the default branch. I am compiling it in master, which is my default branch, and still doesn't work
Many thanks in advance!

When I researched this problem, the solution says if you are using a nullable command you need to use a length like this: @Column(nullable = false, length = 4096) and this does not solve my problem.
Wrong but If I can't solve I'm gonna add a Soft Delete endpoint with PUT annotation and just update is_deleted part to true.
Thank you for your help!
Edit: When I delete these lines problem is solved but delete is not soft anymore:
@SQLDelete(sql = ""UPDATE permission SET is_deleted = true WHERE id=?"")
@Where(clause = ""is_deleted=false"")

The most important part of the error is the `DataIntegrityViolationException` and the message ""could not delete; [constraint][cloud.alias.domain.Permission]"". This suggests there might be a database constraint preventing the deletion of the permission, possibly a foreign key constraint from another table referencing this permission."

  export interface IUser {

And when I try to use autocomplete, only my types (AvatarOwnProps) are displayed, but if I manually write for example onClick, TypeScript doesn't complain and everything works as it should.
It's not critical as I can still put in the attribute I want on my own, but could this be a problem in my code? I am using WebStorm to write the code

",['https://i.sstatic.net/wsOQD2Y8.png'],React - Avatar Component Key Prop is Null or Undefined,"I am working with an Avatar component in my React project and I am encountering an issue where the `size` prop is consistently undefined. I have checked the component documentation and it clearly states that `size` is a valid prop with type `AvatarSize`.

As you can see from the screenshot, the autocomplete suggests `size` as a valid prop but its value remains undefined even when I explicitly pass it.

What could be causing the `size` prop to be undefined even though it's a valid prop for the Avatar component? Is there something else I need to configure to ensure the prop is correctly passed and recognized?"

However, when I run my code, only the first section has the header and footer applied. The remaining sections are missing the header and footer.

The most important part of the error is that the header and footer are only being applied to the first section of the document, not all of them.

Here is the relevant part of my code:

```csharp
foreach (Section wordSection in document.Sections)
{
    // Add header to section
    wordSection.Headers[WdHeaderFooterIndex.wdHeaderFooterPrimary].Range.ParagraphFormat.Alignment = WdParagraphAlignment.wdAlignParagraphCenter;

An apparently unexplainable error keeps happening at runtime, as you can see from the following image:

CoreRE: re::BucketArray<unsigned short*, 32ul>::operator[](unsigned long) + 204
As you can see from the code, my AnchorEntity is not null as there is a guard check.
I also tried to move that code into an objective c static function in order to use @try @catch and catch runtime exceptions, to later realise that RealityKit is not compatible with ObjectiveC.

Any ideas how to fix this please?
I want the response in Postman to have a HTTP 429 status code.
Ideally, my expectation is that both response body and response header should be containing HTTP 429 (here, the response payload status is 429 but the response header contains 200)

The most important part of the error is the `429 Too Many Requests` status code. This indicates that the server is receiving too many requests from the client in a given amount of time."
79041624,How to use switch branch button only seems to work for single repo in multi-root workspace,"I am used to looking at the source control checkout button in vscode as a quick indication of what branch the IDE thinks I'm working on.
This button is in lower left of the status panel as seen here:

When I have several folders open in a multi-root workspace, each with their own repo, this button only works for one of those repos - I can't figure out how to get it to show branch options for any of the other repos.
I've done all sorts of searches like ""vscode multi-root switch branch"", etc. Found nothing that addresses this.
Vscode documentation only address the use of this button in the context of single root repo.
I've also right clicked the branch in the scm view and selected ""make default"" - which didn't help.
How does vscode determine the repo in which to display the current branch?
How can I tell vscode which of the multi-root repos to use for display and actions?

I am using a JSON configuration file to store the settings for code generation.

Specifically, the `extensionConfig.languageContent` property, which should be populated from the configuration, remains empty during code generation. I have verified that the JSON configuration file contains the correct values for the language content.

How can I ensure that the code generation logic correctly reads and applies the `languageContent` values from the JSON configuration file?"

I'm using PM2 to manage the application and NGINX as a reverse proxy. The job IDs are stored in Redis, but for some reason, everything just stops and the Bull queue doesn't process the jobs as expected.
I've tried the following:
Using both local Redis and cloud Redis (e.g., Redis Cloud).
Verified that Redis is running and accessible.
Ensured that my Bull queues are correctly initialized in NestJS.
Restarting the app with PM2.
However, the issue persists, and jobs in the queue don't seem to get processed consistently. Any ideas or suggestions on what might be causing this?
Tech Stack:

NestJS (using @nestjs/bull)
Bull (v4.x)
PM2 (for process management)
NGINX (for reverse proxy)
Redis (both local and Redis Cloud)

Additional Info:

Redis connection is established successfully.
Jobs get queued but are not processed.
Everything stops after a while, and Bull doesn't seem to be running well.
Thank you for your help!

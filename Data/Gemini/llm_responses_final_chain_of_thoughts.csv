But, I now specifically need access to the event.currentTarget property.

The only way I know of to make TypeScript aware of the currentTarget property is to change HTMLElement to a more specific type, like HTMLButtonElement. But that breaks polymorphism because the developer could pick a tag like ""a"" which means I would need to change the callback event type to HTMLAnchorElement
Is there a generic React Typescript type for HTMLElement that accepts a tag string?  Like HTMLElement<'button'>. I'm just not aware of a generic type that can allow me to set the event conditionally based on an HTML tag name.

79143556,How to get accurate code coverage report using gcovr for MSYS2 MINGW64 Clang project?,"I try to use gcovr tool to obtain code coverage of a C++ project built on Windows using MSYS2 MINGW64's Clang toolchain.
I've decided to use such setup to mimic how the project is built on the CI system.
The project consists of a test executable E (it uses GoogleTest framework) and two static libraries, L1 and L2, having the following dependencies: L1 -> L2; L1, L2 -> E.
It is build using CMake system.
When building for code coverage, at the very beginning of the whole process I append to all targets the following compiler flags (CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS): -g --coverage -fPIC -O0 -fno-elide-constructors
Then, I generate code coverage report using the following command:
-- C:/msys64/mingw64/bin/gcovr.exe --html index.html --html-details -r <PROJECT_ROOT> --object-directory=<BUILD_DIR> --gcov-executable=llvm-cov gcov --merge-mode-functions=merge-use-line-min --exclude-unreachable-branches --exclude-function-lines --exclude-lines-by-pattern '^\s*\}?\s*$'
The first problem I've encountered is that for at least one source file some functions were found on multiple lines in the same file - what makes no sense to me, as e.g. gcovr reported one of such functions to start in L183 and L185, whereas it actually starts in L185 and L183 contains the closing brace of totally different function. I have no clue why I got this error, but managed to bypass it by using --merge-mode-functions=merge-use-line-min flag.
However, the resulting report is garbage. In particular, numerous empty lines as well as lines containing only comments/closing braces are marked as ""not hit"" what makes the output rather not useful.
Note that I've used --exclude-lines-by-pattern '^\s*\}?\s*$' flag, but for some reason it did not filter out the mentioned problematic lines.
Here is an excerpt from the generated report:

What should I do to make the results more accurate? Use different compiler/linker flags? A different coverage tool?
A different toolchain is not so feasible solution, as then I would have to constantly rebuild the whole project to switch between e.g. Clang <-> GCC.

",['https://i.sstatic.net/AJzeUB68.png'],OpenCV eccentricity calculation returns 0 for both circles and lines when using cv::fitEllipse,"I'm trying to calculate the eccentricity of a contour in an image using OpenCV in C++. I'm basing my approach on the `regionprops` function in MATLAB, which defines eccentricity as ""the ratio of the distance between the foci of the ellipse and its major axis length.""

Here's the code I'm using:

```c++
double computeEccentricity(const cv::Mat& objectMask)
{
    static constexpr auto MIN_NUMBER_OF_POINTS_TO_FIT_ELLIPSE{5}; // Required by OpenCV.

    if (cv::countNonZero(objectMask) < MIN_NUMBER_OF_POINTS_TO_FIT_ELLIPSE)
    {
        return 0.0;
    }

    std::vector<std::vector<cv::Point>> contours;

    cv::findContours(tmp, contours, cv::RETR_EXTERNAL, cv::ContourApproximationModes::CHAIN_APPROX_NONE);

    const auto& contour{contours[0]};
    // Calculate eccentricity here
}
```

I've successfully extracted the contour of the object from the mask, but I'm not sure how to proceed with calculating the eccentricity. I've found some resources online that suggest fitting an ellipse to the contour and then calculating the eccentricity from the ellipse parameters, but I'm not sure how to implement this in OpenCV.

Can anyone provide guidance or code examples on how to calculate the eccentricity of a contour in OpenCV, specifically following the definition used by MATLAB's `regionprops` function?"

",['https://i.sstatic.net/2zhk1YM6.png'],Swoole\ExitException thrown when using OneLogin PHP SAML library for redirect in Laravel application,"## Swoole\ExitException after SAML login redirect in Laravel 

I'm implementing SAML authentication in my Laravel application using the OneLogin toolkit. While the authentication process seems to work, I'm encountering a `Swoole\ExitException` with the message ""swoole exit"" immediately after the SAML response is received and a redirect is attempted.

The exception is thrown at line 377 of `vendor/onelogin/php-saml/src/Saml2/Utils.php`, which is simply `exit();` after setting the `Location` header for the redirect.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

```php
header('Pragma: no-cache');
header('Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate');
header('Location: ' . $url);
exit(); 
```

I'm running PHP 8.2.25, Laravel 11.30.0, and using Swoole as the web server. 

I've verified that:

- The `$url` variable contains the correct redirect URL.
- The SAML response is successfully processed and validated.
- The exception occurs only when using Swoole; it works fine with PHP's built-in server.

I've tried disabling Swoole's coroutine features, but the issue persists. 

How can I prevent this `Swoole\ExitException` and allow the redirect to complete successfully after SAML login?"

With REST endpoints set up by spring-boot-starter-data-rest.
When calling POST /myapi/employees with an example request body:
{
    ""firstName"": ""This One"",
    ""lastName"": ""Should not pass"",
    ""email"": ""pepefi11221@re.co"",
    ""points"": 21
}

I can see that employeeRepository in UniqueEmailValidator is not injected despite using @Component and @Autowired annotations, and remains null, resulting in NullPointerException and HV000028: Unexpected exception during isValid call in the HTTP response.

I've tried using @Service instead @Component, also tinkered a bit with @Bean, to no avail - the result is always the same.
How to make Spring Boot inject employeeRepository correctly?
",['https://i.sstatic.net/fzGmlmh6.png'],Spring Boot Custom Validator - NullPointerException when accessing Autowired Repository,"I'm encountering a `NullPointerException` in my Spring Boot application while trying to validate the uniqueness of an email address using a custom validator. The error occurs when calling `employeeRepository.existsByEmail(email)`.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

```java
@Component
public class UniqueEmailValidator implements ConstraintValidator<UniqueEmail, String> {

    @Autowired
    private EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;

    @Override
    public boolean isValid(String email, ConstraintValidatorContext context) {
        if (email == null || email.isBlank()) {
            return true; // Let other annotations like @NotBlank handle null/empty cases
        }

        var isUniqueEmail = employeeRepository.existsByEmail(email); // NullPointerException here

        return isUniqueEmail;
    }
}
```

The debugger shows that `employeeRepository` is `null` at the point of the exception. I've already verified that:

- `EmployeeRepository` is an interface extending `JpaRepository`.
- The `@Autowired` annotation is present.
- The validator class is annotated with `@Component`.

I've tried various solutions like:

- Using `@Repository` annotation on `EmployeeRepository`.
- Manually creating a bean for `EmployeeRepository`.
- Checking for circular dependencies.

However, the issue persists. What could be causing the `employeeRepository` to be `null` despite using `@Autowired`?"
79139703,How can I show an unauthorized view when HttpClient gets 403 from calling API in .NET Blazor Web Assembly?,"Basically here is my scenario that I'm going to achieve:

I have two users: A and B, A has the permission to access my Restful API developed with ASP.NET Core Web API, B doesn't have the permission to access that API resource (API will return 403)
In my Blazor Web Assembly app, there is a page which will read data from this Restful API, so, I would like when A user logs in, s/he can access this page correctly, but when B logs in, since B doesn't have the access to the API, therefore, when the page is loading and reading data from API, the page will get 403 error and should instead show something like ""You don't have permission to access the page""

So, in the OnInitializedAsync method of the Blazor page, it uses injected IHttpClientFactory to create an HttpClient, and makes a call to the API:
using var httpClient = HttpClientFactory.CreateClient(""stickersHttpClient"");
var httpResponseMessage = await httpClient.GetAsync($""api/stickers?page={pageNumber}&size={pageSize}"");
httpResponseMessage.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
var responseJson = await httpResponseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
PageContent = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<StickersPage>(responseJson);

If it is user B who opens this page, the httpClient.GetAsync will definitely return 403 error, but instead of showing a ""You don't have permission to view this page"" error on the page, the page actually reported an error in the console:

I have already applied @attribute [Authorize] on the page, and in the App.razor it has the following authorized view settings:
<CascadingAuthenticationState>
    <Router AppAssembly=""@typeof(App).Assembly"">
        <Found Context=""routeData"">
            <AuthorizeRouteView RouteData=""@routeData"" DefaultLayout=""@typeof(MainLayout)"">
                <NotAuthorized>
                    @if (context.User.Identity?.IsAuthenticated != true)
                    {
                        <RedirectToLogin />
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        <p role=""alert"">You don't have permission to view this page.</p>
                    }
                </NotAuthorized>
            </AuthorizeRouteView>
            <FocusOnNavigate RouteData=""@routeData"" Selector=""h1"" />
        </Found>
        <NotFound>
            <PageTitle>Not found</PageTitle>
            <LayoutView Layout=""@typeof(MainLayout)"">
                <p role=""alert"">Sorry, there's nothing at this address.</p>
            </LayoutView>
        </NotFound>
    </Router>
</CascadingAuthenticationState>

I think there should be some gap between the API and the page, there should be the way allowing my razor page to ""know"" about the 403 returned by the API so that it could apply the routed authentication view. But I don't know how can I do that.

79132115,Run Roboelectric in Unit Testing and Most Efficient way to perform instrument test at physical device,"I'm doing some old codelab on testing here, But in the codelab it uses Roboelectric in UnitTest folder, but when I run that it stuck on this part

    private lateinit var tasksViewModel: TasksViewModel

}

Well I know that the purpose of the UnitTest is to run the test faster, I on the later codelab it stated that it's faster to mock / fake the repository and pass it to the viewModel rather than using context and instantiate the viewModel (which remove the AndroidJUnit4 test runner) and remove the roboelectric test that takes ages to run.

My question is that so does the Roboelectric fall into the Instrumented test (which belong to the AndroidTest folder) or the unitTest, because it seems I can't run the test because it hang indefinately.

Also my other question, is how to setup your physical device for instrument and end to end testing efficiently. In many cases, you need to install the app, activate the Display pop up windows while running background for each app and run the testing. Does there any alternative way of doing the instrument / end to end testing in the physical device?


Thanks for reading this. And It will probably my reminder to doing testing in the future

But when I added a ComplexType inside an Owned property like the following:
//(I'm using Asp Identity)
public class User : IdentityUser

    public required UserMetaData MetaData { get; set; } = new(default);
}
[Owned]
public record UserMetaData(string Id)

I had build issues after generating migration:

I tried to manually specify this property is complex using Fluent Method like this, but it doesn't seem to exist there:
builder.Entity<User>(e =>
{
//  e.ComplexProperty(x => x.MetaData.Trashed_); // Can call ComplexProperty

    e.OwnsOne(

            // o.ComplexProperty(x => x.Trashed_); // Can't call complex property here.
        }
    );

So does EF Core 8 support complex type inside owned property, or not yet?

",['https://i.sstatic.net/z1YwbLo5.png'],How to access data from a JSON response in Postman?,"I am sending a GET request to my backend Spring Boot application using Thunder Client. The request successfully returns a 200 OK status and the expected JSON response. However, the ""createTime"" field in the JSON response shows ""12:00:00"" regardless of the actual time stored in the database.

Here is the JSON response I am receiving:

```json
{
  ""diaryId"": 2,
  ""userId"": 2,
  ""createDate"": ""2022-05-05"",
  ""createTime"": ""12:00:00"",

  ""totalFiber"": 2.1,
  ""totalSugar"": 1.2,
  ""totalSodium"": 1.1,
  ""totalCalories"": 1.21
}
```

I have verified that the database stores the correct time for the ""createTime"" field. I have also tried restarting my Spring Boot application and checking for any potential data serialization issues, but the problem persists.

What could be causing the ""createTime"" field to always return ""12:00:00"" in the JSON response, even though the database contains the correct time?"
79130607,Why does the Bulma CSS framwork change the z-index on hover?,"I am looking into rendering performance issues of my website and I have found that I get a lot of repaints while just moving the mouse pointer around.
Example: the HTML-Box below the input field and button get a repaint each time I move the mouse pointer (hovering only) between the input and the button in this page (from the official Bulma docs)

I am using the Bulma CSS framework with an ""add-on""-arrangement on some elements. A deeper analysis has show that such buttons and inputs have their z-index changed on hover. The relevant scss code in Bulma is this:
From tools.scss:
  .#{iv.$class-prefix}button,
  .#{iv.$class-prefix}input,
  .#{iv.$class-prefix}select select {
    &:not([disabled]) {
      &:hover,
      &.#{iv.$class-prefix}is-hovered {
        z-index: 2;
      }

      &:focus,
      &.#{iv.$class-prefix}is-focused,
      &:active,
      &.#{iv.$class-prefix}is-active {
        z-index: 3;

        &:hover {
          z-index: 4;
        }
      }
    }
  }

What is the logic behind such a z-index change on hover?
It's causing a ton of repaints on my quite complex website. Do other CSS frameworks have a similar function? I am tempted to remove/neuter these z-index changes.

79130529,Adding a new package broke my Spring Boot Application,"I'm getting troubles since I have added a new package in my spring boot application containing Mapstructs' mappers. Looks like the field:
@Autowired    
private UtenteMapper utenteMapper; 

is not being populated in my Service component. The Spring boot main class, PaniECumpanagghiuApplicationConfiguration, is quite essential, (it contains only the @SpringBootApplicationAnnotation annotation), but I've tried previously to add a @ComponentScan.
@SpringBootApplication    
@ComponentScan(""PaniECumpanagghiu.PaniECumpanagghiu.Mappers"")

In this way the functionality is being recovered, but the @Controller is not fired (when I invoke my API the server retrieves 404). I tried also to add all the packages into the annotation @ComponentScan, like this
@ComponentScan(""PaniECumpanagghiu.PaniECumpanagghiu.Mappers"",""PaniECumpanagghiu.PaniECumpanagghiu.controller"",...)
In this way neither the former object, UtenteMapper, is populated anymore (same behavior than the case without @ComponentScan annotation).
If I comment all references to the new package, and I simplify the API in order to return only a String (""Ciao""), the controller is fired. This is my tree directory

I have described everything in the previous section.

Testing ShadCN UI with a simple Next.js 15 project (without Vercel Commerce); it works fine.
Adding @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu directly to package.json, but it didn’t resolve the issue.
Environment

Next.js Version: 15.0.0-rc.1
Package Manager: pnpm
Vercel Commerce Template: Latest version after Next.js 15 update

Expected Behavior
ShadCN UI should work as expected with the Vercel Commerce template, just like it did with the previous version of Next.js
Question
Is this a known compatibility issue between Radix UI in ShadCN and Vercel Commerce’s dependency versions? If so, are there any workarounds, or will I need to modify dependencies manually to get these components working together?
Additional Info
I’ve noticed that Radix UI components are deeply embedded in ShadCN, which may be causing version conflicts in the Vercel Commerce template. Any guidance on resolving this conflict would be helpful

I am getting a `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable` error when trying to access the `json_schema_extra` attribute of a Pydantic field.

Here is the relevant code snippet:

```python
from typing import Dict
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class Foo(BaseModel):
    model_fields: Dict[str, FieldInfo] = ...

    def conf(self, **kwargs):
        """"""Metadata about the fields defined on the model.""""""

```

The error occurs on this line:

```python
self.model_fields[k].json_schema_extra[""prompt""] = kwargs[k]
```

It seems that `self.model_fields[k].json_schema_extra` is evaluating to `None`, which is causing the error when I try to access it like a dictionary.

I have checked the Pydantic documentation and confirmed that `json_schema_extra` should be a dictionary. I have also tried printing the value of `self.model_fields[k].json_schema_extra` before accessing it, and it does indeed print `None`.

What could be causing `json_schema_extra` to be `None` in this case? How can I fix this error and access the `json_schema_extra` dictionary as intended?"

I know the tool may not be able to detect such code as covered, as discussed here, however, is the any way to write the tests so that they show as covered? As you can see I tried several alternative ways to perform the same test, all of them failing to be covered in the same instantiation line.

- `lengthTestOriginal` uses the `expected` attribute of the `@Test` annotation.

",['https://i.sstatic.net/lGZ044A9.png'],React useEffect and useLayoutEffect firing order and dependency array usage clarification,"I'm trying to understand the execution order of `useLayoutEffect`, `useEffect`, and the rendering process in a React component. I have a simple component with a counter and console logs to track when each hook is called:

```javascript
export default function CompA() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    console.log('CompA layoutEffectCallback');
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('CompA updateEffectCallback');
  }, [count]);

  // useEffect(() => {
  //   setCount(count + 1);
  //   console.log('CompA initialEffectCallback');
  // }, []);

  const handleClick = () => {
    sayPhase('click');
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div onClick={handleClick}>
      CompA
      <h1>{count}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

I've set a breakpoint in the debugger at the first `console.log` inside the `useLayoutEffect`. Based on my understanding, I expected the following order of logs:

1. **CompA layoutEffectCallback** (since it's called after the DOM is updated)
2. **CompA updateEffectCallback** (as it depends on `count`)

However, I'm not seeing the second log statement in the console. 

Can someone explain why the `useEffect` is not being triggered even though the component is rendering and the `count` state is being updated?"
79126371,Override (reintroduce) property with typescript declaration merging,"The base/built-in declaration of Event and GlobalEventHandlersEventMap looks like so:
// lib.dom.d.ts

interface Event {
    /**
     * Returns the type of event, e.g. ""click"", ""hashchange"", or ""submit"".
     */
    readonly type: string;   // <-- note this part
}

interface GlobalEventHandlersEventMap {
    click: MouseEvent;
    //... all sorts of other built in events...
}

Let's say I define an EventTriggered whose constructor has a parameter containing one of the properties named in GlobalEventHandlersEventMap:
class EventTriggered {
    constructor(
        readonly eventName: keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap
    ) {}
}

This means that the following works because there is a property named 'click':
new EventTriggered('click');

But the following will not work (this is ok and intended):
new EventTriggered('some-random-string');

Now I want to use this class inside an event listener, like so:
function onClick(event: Event): void {
    new EventTriggered(event.type);
}

This will fail because as in the first example, event.type contains ""any string"". Type casting could be one way of solving this:
function onClick(event: Event): void {
    new EventTriggered(event.type as keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap);
}

BUT in my opinion, the original declaration of type is wrong - it should not be string, but keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap.
I tried doing that with declaration merging:
// global.d.ts
interface Event {
    readonly type: keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap;
}

What happens then is that the previous error still shows up, but now my IDE shows that type has two declarations:


I also saw this question, but it feels different - for one thing, I'm not getting the same error as that one: TypeScript declaration merging - changing a property type
",['https://i.sstatic.net/oFNHpsA4.png'],Typescript - Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap',"I'm having trouble understanding why TypeScript is giving me two type options for `e.type` in an event listener. Here's the situation:

```typescript
element.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
  // ...
  const eventType = e.type; 
});
```

When I hover over `e.type`, my IDE (VS Code) shows a ""Choose Declaration"" popup with these options:

1. `type: keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap... (Event, /src/global.d.ts)`
2. `type: string (Event, typescript, dom)`

I understand that `e.type` should return the type of the event (e.g., 'click', 'mouseover'). The second option (`string`) seems to align with this. However, I'm unsure what the first option (`keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap`) means and why it's being suggested. 

I've tried looking into `GlobalEventHandlersEventMap`, but I haven't found a clear explanation that helps me understand this situation. 

Could someone please explain:

* What `keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap` represents in this context?
* Why are both options being presented, and how do they differ?
* Which option is more appropriate to use in general, and why?"

79121996,VIM snippet (UltiSnips): pad line until column 80 reached with a character,"The code I often work at has a comment style like
#---------------------------------------------
# this is a comment
#---------------------------------------------
this.is_code()

I wanted to write a VIM snippet (using UltiSnips) that pads the comment box up until column number 80 (or better until vims colorcolumn). It should take the indentation level into account and always fill the dashes up until column 80.
I have a working snippet present that looks like this
snippet #
#`!p snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
# $1
#`!p snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
$0
endsnippet

Problem here is that when I start typing the number of dashes moves back. Because while I enter a comment the cursor I use in the snipept moves.
I think I need a pyhton or VIM variable that holdes the lines column from which I can subtract 80. But I can't find anything that works for this case.
Edit:
I've found one possible solution to avoid the moving dashes in the template by checking snip.c By checking for emptyness I can make sure that interpolation is done only once.
snippet #
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
# $1
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
$0
endsnippet

Unfortunately since I still have not found a replacement for using the current cursor position vim.current.window.cursor I get wrong lengths for snippets that have comments in indented blocks. For example:
snippet if
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
# if comment
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
IF( $1 )
   #`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
   # inside if
   #`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
   $0

79120292,Linux on Windows,"I'm trying to familiarize myself with linux without actually running a virtual machine or installing it directly so I did use WSL (Ubuntu) and I'm confused to why some of the script that should be running in linux won't run.
For example:
""script"": {
  ""start"": ""NODE_ENV=development eleventy --serve""
  ""postinstall"": ""rm -rf node_modules/@types/glob""
}

instead what I did was modify the start to SET NODE_ENV=development && eleventy --serve and remove the postinstall to actually run the program.
Also I'm using nvm-windows to manage my node versions. node -v and nvm -v won't run on linux but npm -v does. See image below: (It runs normally on cmd)

Can anyone help to explain. To my knowledge both windows and linux should run inside wsl.

The error message seems to indicate that the script chrome-extension://5216f022-cd78-49fc-abf9-9e362fc1640f/assets/content-script-preamble.js.js is being blocked due to a violation of the CSP. However, I haven’t made any changes to the manifest or the code recently.
Some additional context:

The extension uses Vite and React.
The error started appearing suddenly, and the extension was working fine previously.
I am not explicitly loading any external scripts apart from the ones within the extension.
My CSP currently allows 'self' and 'wasm-unsafe-eval' under script-src.
I've tried to debug this but can’t seem to pinpoint what might be causing this issue.

My questions:

What might be the cause of this error if nothing has changed in my extension?
How can I resolve the CSP issue to allow the script to load properly?
Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

**Error Message:**

```
Refused to load the script 'chrome-extension://8f7f4b16-3e48-4800-8463-f31d5b30ee64/assets/content-script-preamble.js.js' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: ""script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval' 'inline-speculation-rules' http://localhost:* http://127.0.0.1:*"".

**Context:**

- The extension is being loaded on `https://daisyui.com/`.
- I'm using Vite for bundling.

**Code Snippet:**

```javascript
(async () => {
  if (""assets/content-script-preamble.js.js"")
    await import(
      /* @vite-ignore */
      chrome.runtime.getURL(""assets/content-script-preamble.js.js"")

**Troubleshooting Attempts:**

- I've tried adding `http://daisyui.com/` to the `script-src` directive in my `manifest.json`, but the error persists.
- I've verified that the script files exist at the specified paths within the extension package.

**Question:**

How can I resolve this Content Security Policy error and successfully load these scripts in my Chrome extension? Is there a specific configuration I need to add to my `manifest.json` or a different approach for dynamically loading scripts in this context?"

",['https://i.sstatic.net/DdBchBy4.png'],Flutter Firebase Image Upload - Image URL is null for some meals,"I am building a Flutter app that saves meal data, including images, to Firebase Storage.

As you can see, the ""Breakfast"" meal has a valid image URL, but the ""Lunch"" meal has ""imageUrl: null."" 

I have verified that:

- The image files exist locally and are being uploaded correctly to Firebase Storage.
- The file paths are correct.
- The Firebase Storage rules allow read and write access.

I have tried restarting the app and re-uploading the images, but the issue persists. 

What could be causing the image URL to be stored as ""null"" for some meals, and how can I resolve this issue?"

Turn left onto W 29th ST on NY-9A,0.10,00:03,0.45,00:06

I'm trying to create a simple `timeout` function using Promises and `setTimeout`. I want the Promise to resolve after a specified delay. However, it seems like the Promise is resolving immediately without waiting for the timeout.

Here's my code:

```javascript
function timeout(ms) {
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms, 'done'))
}

timeout(100).then((value) => {
  console.log(value) 
})
```

I expect this code to log ""done"" after 100 milliseconds. Instead, it logs immediately. 

I've checked the syntax and documentation for `setTimeout` and `Promise`, but I can't figure out why the timeout isn't working as expected.

I'm trying to handle keyboard input, specifically the spacebar. I've set up a window procedure (`dev_window_events`) that uses a `switch` statement to handle different window messages.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

```c
LRESULT CALLBACK dev_window_events(HWND hwnd, UINT msg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam) {
    switch (msg) {
        case WM_CLOSE:

The code compiles and runs without errors. However, when I press the spacebar, nothing happens. The message ""SPACE WAS PRESSED"" is not printed to the console or anywhere else.

I've tried:

- Verifying that `VK_SPACE` is the correct virtual key code for the spacebar.
- Checking if other keys trigger the `WM_KEYDOWN` message (they do).
- Debugging to see if the `if` statement within the `WM_KEYDOWN` case is ever reached (it is).

I'm not sure what else to check. Why isn't my code detecting the spacebar press?"

79097264,Correctly tear down process when using pytest with multiprocessing,"I am working on a package that includes a server with the corresponding client.
I was thinking that I could save a lot of effort mocking all the interactions and just write some test cases that test both sides at the same time.

When the tests are done I tear down the process using process.terminate(). Unfortunately there is another ""orphaned"" process that I can't seem to get a handle on.
How do I remove the other process or how do I avoid starting it in the first place?

",['https://i.sstatic.net/pBdrFujf.png'],Java Swing Calculator - Error Handling for Invalid Input Ranges and Expressions,"I am trying to create a Java program that calculates the summation of a polynomial expression over a given range. The user is prompted to enter the start value, end value, and the polynomial expression. 

However, when I run the program and input the values, I get an ""Error - invalid input!"" message in the calculator's text field. I have checked my input values, and they seem to be correct. 

Here is the relevant code snippet:

I have tried inputting various polynomial expressions and ranges, but the error persists. I am not sure what is causing this ""invalid input"" error.

79090291,Access Violation exception when calling DLL function loaded with boost import_alias,"I am trying to call a function from a DLL. The API for the DLL looks like this:

    #else
        #define API __attribute__((visibility(""default"")))
    #endif
#endif


API void* construct(const char* initString);

I am loading that function call using boost, and then trying to call it:
#include <boost/dll/import.hpp>
#include <boost/function.hpp>
#include <boost/filesystem.hpp>
#include <iostream>


typedef void* (ConstructT)(const char*);

    );
    
    std::string initArg = ""hello"";
    void* pluginInstance = constructFunc(initArg.c_str());
    std::cout << pluginInstance << std::endl;
}

However, it is failing on the call of the constructFunc, throwing an error at the following code in boost/dll/import.hpp:
        // Compilation error at this point means that imported function
        // was called with unmatching parameters.
        //

        // f(""Hello"");  // error: invalid conversion from 'const char*' to 'int'
        // f(1, 2);     // error: too many arguments to function
        // f();         // error: too few arguments to function

        {
            return (*f_)(static_cast<Args&&>(args)...);
        }

Why is this failing? The type of std::string.c_str() is const char*, so it seems like it is the correct type.
For reference, my DLL code looks like this:

Here's the relevant code snippet:

}
```

The error message suggests that the issue might be related to mismatched function parameters. However, I've double-checked the function signature in both the calling code and the shared library, and they appear to match.

I've also tried explicitly casting the arguments to the correct types, but the error persists.

**What I've Tried:**

- Verified function signature matching.
- Explicitly cast arguments to the expected types.

**Environment:**

- Operating System: Windows

I'm unsure what else to check at this point. Any insights into why this error might be occurring and how to resolve it would be greatly appreciated."
79089650,Laravel Broadcasting not firing on the Job Queue,"I am creating a AI ChatBot. The message is entered on the frontend (Livewire) and then stored in the database. A model ""created"" listener then pushes a job onto the queue which asks the AI (LLM) the prompt and the answer is then updated on the model (on the queue). There is then an ""updated"" listener, which fires a broadcasting event.
On the front end the Livewire component is listening via Laravel Echo for the updated event, and the chat response is shown to the user.
The problem I have is that the broadcasting event works, but not on the queue. I have tested it via a Console Command and it updates the chat, but when the job is processed on the queue, no update occurs.
I have checked the Herd logs, and again, I can see the event broadcasting when I manually trigger with the Console Command, but no event is broadcasted when the job is processed on the queue.
So:

The job to get the llm response is always successfully processed on the queue when the model is created
The LlmMessage model is always updated successfully by this job, and the response is stored
The LlmMessageUpdated event is broadcasted and the Livewire Component updated when a manual update is triggered
The LlmMessageUpdated event is not broadcasted and the Livewire Component is not updated when the job updates the model

As you can see, this piece of code doesn’t seem to show any errors, because if there were compilation errors, the 'try' and 'except' should have caught them, but they didn’t.
At the same time, the SQL database still doesn’t have any data like Tony and others.

Can you tell me what technique is used for that? I can rephrase a question: how to dynamically generate a DOM Element, a template of which is managed by Angular. I even fine if change detection will not work automatically (it probably won't).

  - ${{ if eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/develop') }}:
    - template: pipeline-develop.yml

The Issue:
This pipeline does not trigger automatically when a commit is pushed to Repo B on either develop or master. I cannot use checkout because it only accepts self or none. However, Repo B is successfully cloned, and the pipeline runs fine if I trigger it manually
Additional Considerations:

Build services have ""Read and Contribute"" permissions set to ""Allow"" in both repositories.
Both Repo A and Repo B are part of the same project.
The Personal Access Token (PAT) is correctly configured, and the pipeline passes when executed manually.


Question:
Why is the pipeline not triggering automatically, and how can I ensure it runs whenever a commit is pushed to Repo B?
Update
I have read many posts warning about compiling the YAML file in the default branch. I am compiling it in master, which is my default branch, and still doesn't work
Many thanks in advance!
",['https://i.sstatic.net/820vUuoT.png'],Azure Pipelines: Checkout of repository is not supported when checking out multiple repositories,"I am trying to set up an Azure DevOps pipeline to build and deploy my code. I have multiple repositories that I need to access in my pipeline. However, when I try to run the pipeline, I get the following error:

```
Could not queue the build because there were validation errors or warnings. Checkout of repository [Repository Name] is not supported. Only 'self' and 'none' are supported. Checkout of multiple repositories is not supported.
```

My `azure-pipelines.yml` file looks like this:

```yaml
trigger: none

resources:
  repositories:
  - repository: [Repository Name]
    type: git
    name: [Repository Name]
    ref: develop
    trigger: 
      branches:
        include:
        - develop
        - master

pool:
  name: 'Test'

variables:
  ArtifactName: 'drop'
  JSON_EXISTS: false
  REPO_URL: [Repository URL]

steps:
  - checkout: self
  - checkout: [Repository Name] 
```

I have tried using both the repository name and the repository URL in the `checkout` step, but neither of them worked. I have also tried setting the `checkout` step to `none`, but that also did not work.

How can I checkout multiple repositories in my Azure DevOps pipeline?"

When I researched this problem, the solution says if you are using a nullable command you need to use a length like this: @Column(nullable = false, length = 4096) and this does not solve my problem.
Wrong but If I can't solve I'm gonna add a Soft Delete endpoint with PUT annotation and just update is_deleted part to true.
Thank you for your help!
Edit: When I delete these lines problem is solved but delete is not soft anymore:
@SQLDelete(sql = ""UPDATE permission SET is_deleted = true WHERE id=?"")
@Where(clause = ""is_deleted=false"")

",['https://i.sstatic.net/FyOBqpDV.png'],Spring DataIntegrityViolationException: could not delete entity due to foreign key constraint,"I am trying to delete a permission with ID 100 via a DELETE request to `/api/v1/permission/{id}` endpoint in my Spring Boot application. However, I am encountering a `DataIntegrityViolationException` with the message ""could not delete: [com.cloud.atlas.domain.Permission#100]; SQL [UPDATE permission SET is_deleted = true WHERE id=?];"".

It seems like there might be a constraint violation preventing the deletion. I have checked the database and confirmed that the permission with ID 100 exists. I have also verified that no other tables have a foreign key constraint referencing this permission.

I am using Spring Boot with Hibernate. Below is the relevant code snippet:

```java
// Service method for deleting permission
@Transactional
public void delete(Long id) {
    permissionRepository.deleteById(id);
}
```

I have tried debugging the application and found that the exception is thrown during the `permissionRepository.deleteById(id)` call. I have also tried manually deleting the permission directly in the database, but it also resulted in a similar constraint violation error.

I have searched for solutions online but couldn't find any that address this specific issue. Any help in understanding the root cause of this error and how to resolve it would be greatly appreciated."

79045792,RealityKit HasTransform.position throws a runtime exception,"I am working on a React Native app, specifically on the iOS native module with RealityKit.
An apparently unexplainable error keeps happening at runtime, as you can see from the following image:

When I try to retrieve the position of my AnchorEntity relative to the world space (so using relativeTo: nil), it triggers a runtime exception during some of its internal calls:
CoreRE: re::BucketArray<unsigned short*, 32ul>::operator[](unsigned long) + 204
As you can see from the code, my AnchorEntity is not null as there is a guard check.
I also tried to move that code into an objective c static function in order to use @try @catch and catch runtime exceptions, to later realise that RealityKit is not compatible with ObjectiveC.
Do you have any idea/suggestion on how to fix it/prevent it?
",['https://i.sstatic.net/v8wLBHbo.png'],Swift/ARKit - ReplateCameraController No anchor set yet error when taking photo,"I'm working on an ARKit project in Swift and trying to get the position of an anchor using `anchorNode.position(relativeTo:)`. However, I'm consistently getting a nil value for `anchorNode` even though I've verified that the anchor is being added to the scene.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

```swift
guard let anchorNode = ReplateCameraView.anchorEntity else {
    safeRejecter(""001"", ""[ReplateCameraController] No anchor set yet"", NSError(domain:
    ""ReplateCameraController"", code: 001, userInfo: nil))

// Use the Objective-C helper to safely retrieve the anchor position
let anchorPosition = anchorNode.position(relativeTo: nil) 
```

I've tried accessing the `anchorEntity` property directly from my `ARView` but it's always nil. I've also confirmed that the anchor is being added successfully and is visible in the scene.

What could be causing `anchorEntity` to be nil even though the anchor is present in the scene? Am I accessing it incorrectly or is there something else I need to do to retrieve the anchor node?"

",['https://i.sstatic.net/pPKxvQfg.png'],Javascript console.log() styling breaks when string contains newline characters,"I'm trying to apply CSS styles within a `console.log` statement using `%c` format specifiers.

Can anyone provide more information on how to properly use the `screenshotPaths` property and what its purpose is within the SPFx packaging process?"
79041900,Http 429 is not returnable in status code from C# ASP.NET Core Web API,"[Route(""{route}"")]
[HttpPost]
public async Task<System.Net.Http.HttpResponseMessage> Post([FromBody] dynamic data)
{
    var test = new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.TooManyRequests);
    return test;
}

Implementing an ASP.NET Core Web API controller. The intention is to return HTTP 429.
However, the 429 is returned in the response body but the actual response is HTTP 200
Example response from Postman below
{
    ""Version"": ""1.1"",
    ""Content"": {
        ""Headers"": []
    },
    ""StatusCode"": 429,
    ""ReasonPhrase"": ""Too Many Requests"",
    ""Headers"": [],
    ""TrailingHeaders"": [],
    ""RequestMessage"": null,
    ""IsSuccessStatusCode"": false
}


Any ideas how to fix this please?
I want the response in Postman to have a HTTP 429 status code.
Ideally, my expectation is that both response body and response header should be containing HTTP 429 (here, the response payload status is 429 but the response header contains 200)
",['https://i.sstatic.net/jtsyQ5SF.png'],"HTTP 200 OK, but StatusCode: 429 ""Too Many Requests"" in response body - C# HTTPClient?","I am receiving a `429 Too Many Requests` error in my application, but the response status code in my code is showing as `200 OK`. I am unsure why this discrepancy exists.

Here is the JSON response I am receiving:

```json
{
  ""Version"": ""1.1"",
  ""Content"": {
    ""Headers"": []
  },
  ""StatusCode"": 429,
  ""ReasonPhrase"": ""Too Many Requests"",
  ""Headers"": [],
  ""TrailingHeaders"": [],
  ""RequestMessage"": null,
  ""IsSuccessStatusCode"": false
}
```

Despite the `StatusCode` being `429`, the HTTP status returned is `200 OK`. I have checked my code for any potential issues and reviewed the relevant documentation, but I am unable to determine the cause of this issue.

Why am I getting a `200 OK` status code when the response clearly indicates a `429 Too Many Requests` error?"
79041624,How to use switch branch button only seems to work for single repo in multi-root workspace,"I am used to looking at the source control checkout button in vscode as a quick indication of what branch the IDE thinks I'm working on.
This button is in lower left of the status panel as seen here:

When I have several folders open in a multi-root workspace, each with their own repo, this button only works for one of those repos - I can't figure out how to get it to show branch options for any of the other repos.
I've done all sorts of searches like ""vscode multi-root switch branch"", etc. Found nothing that addresses this.
Vscode documentation only address the use of this button in the context of single root repo.
I've also right clicked the branch in the scm view and selected ""make default"" - which didn't help.
How does vscode determine the repo in which to display the current branch?
How can I tell vscode which of the multi-root repos to use for display and actions?
",['https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces/hero.png'],How to convert TextMate grammar to VS Code grammar in a VS Code extension?,"I'm working on a project that involves parsing and converting grammar files in a Visual Studio Code extension. I'm encountering an issue in my `grammarConverter.js` file where I need to populate an `extensionConfig` object with information extracted from a grammar file.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

```javascript
function convertGrammar(location, extensionConfig) {
  extensionConfig.languageId = '';
  extensionConfig.languageName = '';
  extensionConfig.languageScopeName = '';
  extensionConfig.languageExtensions = [];

  if (!location) {
    extensionConfig.languageContent = '';
    return Promise.resolve();
  }

  // Logic to extract information from the grammar file and populate extensionConfig
}
```

Currently, the `extensionConfig` object is being initialized with empty strings and an empty array. I need to replace these placeholders with the actual values parsed from the grammar file.

I've already imported necessary modules like `fs` and `path` for file system operations. However, I'm unsure about the most effective way to:

1. Read and parse the grammar file content based on its format (e.g., JSON, XML).
2. Extract the required information like `languageId`, `languageName`, etc.
3. Populate the `extensionConfig` object with the extracted values.

Could someone please guide me on how to achieve this grammar file parsing and `extensionConfig` population within the `convertGrammar` function? Any code examples or suggestions on suitable parsing libraries would be highly appreciated."

79041481,"NestJs/Bull, runs fine locally but does not work in the cloud","I'm facing an issue with implementing a Bull queue in my NestJS application. I'm using PM2 to manage the application and NGINX as a reverse proxy. The job IDs are stored in Redis, but for some reason, everything just stops and the Bull queue doesn't process the jobs as expected.
I've tried the following:
Using both local Redis and cloud Redis (e.g., Redis Cloud).
Verified that Redis is running and accessible.
Ensured that my Bull queues are correctly initialized in NestJS.
Restarting the app with PM2.
However, the issue persists, and jobs in the queue don't seem to get processed consistently. Any ideas or suggestions on what might be causing this?
Tech Stack:

NestJS (using @nestjs/bull)
Bull (v4.x)
PM2 (for process management)
NGINX (for reverse proxy)
Redis (both local and Redis Cloud)

Additional Info:

Redis connection is established successfully.
Jobs get queued but are not processed.
Everything stops after a while, and Bull doesn't seem to be running well.
Thank you for your help!


",['https://i.sstatic.net/6QZANKBM.png'],How to configure Bull queue with Redis Cloud in NestJS?,"I'm working on a NestJS project using the Bull queue library to manage background jobs. I'm trying to configure the BullModule to connect to a Redis instance hosted on Redis Cloud, but I'm unsure how to properly set up the connection parameters within my `app.module.ts` file.

Here's my current configuration:

```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [
    BullModule.forRoot({
      redis: {
        host: 'redis-xxxx.redis-cloud.com',
        port: 14166,

        // port: 6379,
      },
    }),
    // ... other modules
  ],
  // ... other configurations
})
export class AppModule {}
```

I've replaced the actual Redis Cloud hostname and password with placeholders. I've commented out the `localhost` configuration as I want to connect to the remote Redis instance.

I've consulted the Bull documentation and several online resources, but I haven't found a clear example of how to configure the connection string for Redis Cloud. 

How can I correctly configure the `BullModule.forRoot()` method to establish a connection with my Redis Cloud instance?"

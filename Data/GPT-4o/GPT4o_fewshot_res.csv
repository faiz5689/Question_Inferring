79041624,How to Properly Use 'require' in Node.js for Module Imports?,"I'm working on a Node.js project and using the 'require' function to import modules in my JavaScript file. However, I'm unsure if I'm using it correctly, especially when importing custom modules like 'plistParser' and 'request'. Here's a snippet of my code:

```javascript
'use strict';

var path = require('path');
var fs = require('fs');
var plistParser = require('./plistParser');
var request = require('request');
```

I want to ensure that I'm following best practices for module imports. Are there any common pitfalls or improvements I should be aware of when using 'require' in Node.js? Any advice or resources would be greatly appreciated!",How to use switch branch button only seems to work for single repo in multi-root workspace,"I am used to looking at the source control checkout button in vscode as a quick indication of what branch the IDE thinks I'm working on.
This button is in lower left of the status panel as seen here:

When I have several folders open in a multi-root workspace, each with their own repo, this button only works for one of those repos - I can't figure out how to get it to show branch options for any of the other repos.
I've done all sorts of searches like ""vscode multi-root switch branch"", etc. Found nothing that addresses this.
Vscode documentation only address the use of this button in the context of single root repo.
I've also right clicked the branch in the scm view and selected ""make default"" - which didn't help.
How does vscode determine the repo in which to display the current branch?
How can I tell vscode which of the multi-root repos to use for display and actions?

Here's a snippet of my test class:

    private lateinit var tasksViewModel: TasksViewModel

}

    private lateinit var tasksViewModel: TasksViewModel

    // Executes each task synchronously using Architecture Components.

}

Well I know that the purpose of the UnitTest is to run the test faster, I on the later codelab it stated that it's faster to mock / fake the repository and pass it to the viewModel rather than using context and instantiate the viewModel (which remove the AndroidJUnit4 test runner) and remove the roboelectric test that takes ages to run.

My question is that so does the Roboelectric fall into the Instrumented test (which belong to the AndroidTest folder) or the unitTest, because it seems I can't run the test because it hang indefinately.

Also my other question, is how to setup your physical device for instrument and end to end testing efficiently. In many cases, you need to install the app, activate the Display pop up windows while running background for each app and run the testing. Does there any alternative way of doing the instrument / end to end testing in the physical device?

79047610,How to Properly Use Avatar Component with TypeScript in React?,"I'm trying to use an Avatar component in my React project with TypeScript, but I'm encountering some issues with the props. The component is used as follows:

```jsx
<Avatar as=""button"" onClick={() => console.log(1)} src={src} />
```

The IDE suggests several props like `key`, `className`, `color`, `theme`, `alt`, `i18nIsDynamicList`, and `size`, but I'm not sure how to properly define and use them. Could someone explain the correct usage of these props and how to ensure type safety with TypeScript? Any examples or documentation references would be greatly appreciated.",React. Autocomplete typing does not work when using ComponentPropsWithoutRef,"I use this structure to be able to use the Avatar as any ElementType
interface AvatarOwnProps {
    className?: string
    src?: string
    alt?: string
    color?: AvatarColor
    theme?: AvatarTheme
    size?: AvatarSize
}

type AvatarProps<T extends ElementType = 'div'> = {
    as?: T
} & ComponentPropsWithoutRef<T> & AvatarOwnProps

export const Avatar = memo(<T extends ElementType = 'div'>(props: AvatarProps<T>) => {
    ...

        <Component className={classNames(cls.Avatar, {}, additional)} {...other}>
            <img src={initialSrc} alt={alt} />
        </Component>
    )
}


And when I try to use autocomplete, only my types (AvatarOwnProps) are displayed, but if I manually write for example onClick, TypeScript doesn't complain and everything works as it should.
It's not critical as I can still put in the attribute I want on my own, but could this be a problem in my code? I am using WebStorm to write the code

79097264,Debugging a Stopped Server Process in Python Multiprocessing Test,"I'm working on a unit test for a Python application using the `multiprocessing` module. The test involves a server process that should be running, but it seems to stop unexpectedly. In the debugger, I see that `server_process` has a `stopped` status with an exit code of `-SIGTERM`. 

Here's a snippet of the code:

```python
class TestMultiprocessingTester:
    def server_process(self):
        server_process.terminate()
        if server_process.is_alive():
            server_process.kill()
        logging.getLogger(""Process"").warning(""shut down server process"")

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_client(self, server_process: mp.Process):
    await asyncio.sleep(10)
    url = ""http://localhost:5000/todo/api/v1.0/tasks""
    response = requests.get(url)
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()[""tasks""][0][""done""] is False
```

The server process is supposed to be terminated and killed if still alive, but it seems to stop prematurely. Could this be related to how I'm handling the process termination, or is there something else I might be missing? Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",Correctly tear down process when using pytest with multiprocessing,"I am working on a package that includes a server with the corresponding client.
I was thinking that I could save a lot of effort mocking all the interactions and just write some test cases that test both sides at the same time.
So I wrote a fixture that would yield a multiprocessing.Process instance inside which the server is running.
When the tests are done I tear down the process using process.terminate(). Unfortunately there is another ""orphaned"" process that I can't seem to get a handle on.
How do I remove the other process or how do I avoid starting it in the first place?
If you know of a way of doing this with a different library than multiprocessing I am totally open to it.

79145758,TypeScript Error: Property 'currentTarget' Does Not Exist on Type 'HTMLElement',"I'm working with a React component and using TypeScript for type checking. I have a function that logs the `currentTarget` property of an event, but I'm encountering an error: 'Property 'currentTarget' does not exist on type 'HTMLElement'.'

Here's a snippet of my code:

```typescript
export const Box = forwardRef(function Box(
  { as: Element = 'div', ...restProps }: BoxOwnProps,
  ref: Ref<Element>
) {
  const handleOnClick = useCallback((ev: HTMLElement) => {
    console.log(ev.currentTarget);
  }, []);

  return <Element ref={ref} onClick={handleOnClick} {...restProps} />;
});
```

I expected `ev.currentTarget` to be available, but TypeScript is throwing an error. How can I resolve this issue and correctly access `currentTarget` in this context?",Typescript Polymorphic Component Event Handler,"I have written a strongly-typed Polymorphic Typescript React component that can accept any valid HTML tag.  I followed this example here: https://www.tsteele.dev/posts/react-polymorphic-forwardref.

// https://www.tsteele.dev/posts/react-polymorphic-forwardref
// https://gist.github.com/kripod/4434e7cecfdecee160026aee49ea6ee8

import React, {
  forwardRef,
  useCallback,
  type ComponentPropsWithRef,
  type ElementType,
  type JSX,
  type JSXElementConstructor,
  type Ref,
} from 'react';

type IntrinsicAttributes<
  E extends keyof JSX.IntrinsicElements | JSXElementConstructor<any>,
> = JSX.LibraryManagedAttributes<E, ComponentPropsWithRef<E>>;

export interface BoxOwnProps<E extends ElementType = ElementType> {
  as?: E;
}

export type BoxProps<E extends ElementType> = BoxOwnProps<E> &
  Omit<IntrinsicAttributes<E>, keyof BoxOwnProps>;

export const Box = forwardRef(function Box(
  { as: Element = 'div', ...restProps }: BoxOwnProps,
  ref: Ref<Element>
) {
  const handleOnClick = useCallback((ev: HTMLElement) => {
    // 🚨 🚨  The type error is on the next line (see image)
    console.log(ev.currentTarget);
  }, []);

  return <Element ref={ref} onClick={handleOnClick} {...restProps} />;
}) as <E extends ElementType = 'div'>(props: BoxProps<E>) => JSX.Element;

For the handleOnClick callback, I assigned the event in the callback the HTMLElement type from @types/react-dom because it is the parent of all possible HTML dom elements and was generic enough to satisfy TypeScript.
But, I now specifically need access to the event.currentTarget property.

The only way I know of to make TypeScript aware of the currentTarget property is to change HTMLElement to a more specific type, like HTMLButtonElement. But that breaks polymorphism because the developer could pick a tag like ""a"" which means I would need to change the callback event type to HTMLAnchorElement
Is there a generic React Typescript type for HTMLElement that accepts a tag string?  Like HTMLElement<'button'>. I'm just not aware of a generic type that can allow me to set the event conditionally based on an HTML tag name.

79093513,How to Fix Overlapping Popup Issue in Angular Application?,"I'm working on an Angular application and encountering an issue with a popup that overlaps with other elements on the page. The popup is created using Kendo UI and appears when selecting a document type. Despite setting the z-index and dimensions, the popup still overlaps with the dropdown options. 

Here's a snippet of the HTML structure:

```html
<kendo-popup class=""k-animation-container k-animation-container-shown"" style=""left: 248px; top: 269px; z-index: 2; min-width: 360px; width: 360px; height: auto;"">
</kendo-popup>
```

I've tried adjusting the z-index and ensuring the popup is positioned correctly, but the issue persists. Any suggestions on how to resolve this overlapping problem?",Kendo UI for Angular - filterable DropDownList - Search icon misaligned,"I have the following code:
<kendo-dropdownlist formControlName=""documentType"" [data]=""filteredDocumentTypes"" [filterable]=""true"" [valuePrimitive]=""true"" textField=""name"" valueField=""code"" (filterChange)=""filterDocumentTypes($event)"" [class.is-invalid]=""uploadDocumentType.invalid && isUploadInvalid""> </kendo-dropdownlist>
The built-in Search icon is misaligned (see screenshot below). It was ok before.

The screenshot also shows the automatic kendo-popup tag in the Browser Developer tools, seen when a user clicks in Choose Document Type dropdown. As this popup is very dynamic, I can't inspect further the Search icon in Developer Tools to see the automatic Kendo HTML tags and CSS classes so that I can potentially override a CSS class related to the icon.
How can I align the Search icon properly (to be at the beginning of the input field and vertically seen fully)?

79125244,Understanding the Use of RefreshView Flag in Angular's detectChanges(),"In the Angular codebase, I came across the `detectChanges()` function, which uses a `RefreshView` flag. The comment mentions that this flag ensures the view is refreshed if not already dirty and is used intentionally over the `Dirty` flag. However, I'm unclear about the specific role of the `RefreshView` flag and why it is preferred in this context. Could someone explain how this flag works and its advantages over the `Dirty` flag during template execution?",Angular not calling the detectChanges() method on button click (change detection),"I have added a breakpoint in the angular source code on the detectChanges() method:

I noticed that when I click on the button from the component below, the breakpoint is not hit.
import { Component, DoCheck } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-some',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [],
  template: `
    <button (click)=""onClick()"">click me</button>
    <h3>{{ someValue }}</h3>  `,
  styleUrl: './some.component.scss'

  ngDoCheck(): void {
    console.log('ngDoCheck');
  }

  someValue = 'initial value';

  onClick() {
    console.log('onClick');
    this.someValue = 'other';
  }

}

The tick method is indeed called though.
Can someone please explain in the context of angular change detection why the detectChanges() method is not called?

Any tips on structuring the project or using VSCode features would be greatly appreciated.",VSCode move primary side bar to bottom (*not* the activity bar),"In VSCode, I want to move the primary side bar to the bottom, so that it's easier to use VSCode in a profile-oriented monitor. Is this possible either in the settings or with an extension?
Note that I am not talking about the activity bar. I'm talking about the primary side bar, as described here:

By default, the Primary Side Bar is located on the left of the workbench and shows views such as the Explorer, Search, and Source Control views


I want to use a profile-oriented monitor, but having the sidebar on the side takes up ~1/3 of my screen. It'd be much more economical to have it on the bottom.

When I researched this problem, the solution says if you are using a nullable command you need to use a length like this: @Column(nullable = false, length = 4096) and this does not solve my problem.
Wrong but If I can't solve I'm gonna add a Soft Delete endpoint with PUT annotation and just update is_deleted part to true.
Thank you for your help!
Edit: When I delete these lines problem is solved but delete is not soft anymore:
@SQLDelete(sql = ""UPDATE permission SET is_deleted = true WHERE id=?"")
@Where(clause = ""is_deleted=false"")

Could there be an issue with my configuration or setup in Eclipse? Any help would be appreciated.",Adding a new package broke my Spring Boot Application,"I'm getting troubles since I have added a new package in my spring boot application containing Mapstructs' mappers. Looks like the field:
@Autowired    
private UtenteMapper utenteMapper; 

is not being populated in my Service component. The Spring boot main class, PaniECumpanagghiuApplicationConfiguration, is quite essential, (it contains only the @SpringBootApplicationAnnotation annotation), but I've tried previously to add a @ComponentScan.
@SpringBootApplication    
@ComponentScan(""PaniECumpanagghiu.PaniECumpanagghiu.Mappers"")

In this way the functionality is being recovered, but the @Controller is not fired (when I invoke my API the server retrieves 404). I tried also to add all the packages into the annotation @ComponentScan, like this
@ComponentScan(""PaniECumpanagghiu.PaniECumpanagghiu.Mappers"",""PaniECumpanagghiu.PaniECumpanagghiu.controller"",...)
In this way neither the former object, UtenteMapper, is populated anymore (same behavior than the case without @ComponentScan annotation).
If I comment all references to the new package, and I simplify the API in order to return only a String (""Ciao""), the controller is fired. This is my tree directory

I have described everything in the previous section.

        } else {
            // Fallback on earlier versions
        }

but I am not satisfied with that because in one of Apple WWDC video it was mentioned that if we want exempt item from voice over accessibility don't add it in accessibilityItems and if we want in automation elements just add it. They haven't provided deeper details . Reference is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAqzXI3kFCk also adding screenshot about what I am saying
According to this it should be

79126371,TypeScript: Confusion Between Event Type Declarations,"I'm working on a TypeScript project and encountered an issue with event type declarations. When I try to access `e.type`, my IDE presents two options for the type: `keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap` and `string`. This is causing confusion in my code as I'm not sure which type to use for handling events properly. Could someone explain the difference between these two types and suggest the best practice for handling event types in TypeScript?",Override (reintroduce) property with typescript declaration merging,"The base/built-in declaration of Event and GlobalEventHandlersEventMap looks like so:
// lib.dom.d.ts

interface Event {
    /**
     * Returns the type of event, e.g. ""click"", ""hashchange"", or ""submit"".
     */
    readonly type: string;   // <-- note this part
}

interface GlobalEventHandlersEventMap {
    click: MouseEvent;
    //... all sorts of other built in events...
}

Let's say I define an EventTriggered whose constructor has a parameter containing one of the properties named in GlobalEventHandlersEventMap:
class EventTriggered {
    constructor(
        readonly eventName: keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap
    ) {}
}

This means that the following works because there is a property named 'click':
new EventTriggered('click');

But the following will not work (this is ok and intended):
new EventTriggered('some-random-string');

Now I want to use this class inside an event listener, like so:
function onClick(event: Event): void {
    new EventTriggered(event.type);
}

This will fail because as in the first example, event.type contains ""any string"". Type casting could be one way of solving this:
function onClick(event: Event): void {
    new EventTriggered(event.type as keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap);
}

BUT in my opinion, the original declaration of type is wrong - it should not be string, but keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap.
I tried doing that with declaration merging:
// global.d.ts
interface Event {
    readonly type: keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap;
}

What happens then is that the previous error still shows up, but now my IDE shows that type has two declarations:

79126629,Understanding useLayoutEffect Behavior in React Component,"I'm working on a React component and trying to understand the behavior of `useLayoutEffect`. In my `CompA` component, I have a `useLayoutEffect` that logs a message to the console. However, I'm not sure when exactly this effect is supposed to run in relation to other lifecycle methods like `useEffect`.

Here's a snippet of my code:

```javascript
export default function CompA() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    console.log('CompA LayoutEffectCallback');
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('CompA updateEffectCallback');
  }, [count]);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div onClick={handleClick}>
      <h1>CompA</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The debugger pauses at the `useLayoutEffect` line, and I'm trying to figure out the sequence of execution. Can someone explain how `useLayoutEffect` differs from `useEffect` in terms of timing and execution? Any insights would be appreciated!",When will the useLayoutEffect hook callback be triggered?,"I have an question about when will the useLayoutEffect callback be triggered and when will the screen be drawn.
Consider the following code:
export default function CompA() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    // I'll debug here after initial render 
    console.log('CompA layoutEffectCallback');
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('CompA updateEffectCallback');
  }, [count]);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div onClick={handleClick}>
      CompA
      <h1>{count}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

After the initial render, the screen displays the number 0,then I set a chrome devtool debugger in the callback of the useLayoutEffect hook before I click the div. After click, the function execution is paused at debugger, but I see the screen already shown number 1.
The docs said that useLayoutEffect fires before the browser repaints the screen，but I don't understand why the screen has updated.

The generated swagger entry point looks like this now:

Where all the inner classes of my main class are represented by strings. If we just take a look at the first Property (IDFactura), this is the code generated by wsdltophp

     * The IDFactura
     * @var \App\Application\ServiceReferences\Verifactu\StructType\IDFacturaExpedidaType|null
     * @OA\Property()

    protected ?\App\Application\ServiceReferences\Verifactu\StructType\IDFacturaExpedidaType $IDFactura = null;

(The @OA\Schema is also generated by wsdltophp) But it's clear that my SwaggerUI is representing this inner class like a simple string.
Since this WSDL is external and I have no control over it, nor the wsdltophp generated code, I'm looking for a solution which would avoid updating/modifying those external classes

In my view, what_is_z and listify do not work, because my editor does not list the value of the variable in the following example as list[int] as I would expect. Half the reason of type annotations for me is convenience in the editor (the other half being error checking).

Some additional context:

The extension uses Vite and React.
The error started appearing suddenly, and the extension was working fine previously.
I am not explicitly loading any external scripts apart from the ones within the extension.
My CSP currently allows 'self' and 'wasm-unsafe-eval' under script-src.
I've tried to debug this but can’t seem to pinpoint what might be causing this issue.

My questions:

What might be the cause of this error if nothing has changed in my extension?
How can I resolve the CSP issue to allow the script to load properly?
Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

But if I press on the suggestion, nothing happens. And if I try to add manually the dependencies that I have copy-pasted from the android developers page (https://developer.android.com/identity/sign-in/credential-manager-siwg), I get this error when I build my project
Caused by: org.gradle.api.internal.artifacts.ivyservice.DefaultLenientConfiguration$ArtifactResolveException: Could not resolve all files for configuration ':app:debugRuntimeClasspath'.

These are the dependencies I have copied in my code:
implementation(""androidx.credentials:credentials:1.3.0"")
implementation(""androidx.credentials:credentials-play-services-auth:1.3.0"")

implementation(""com.google.android.libraries.identity.googleid:googleid:1.3.0"")

I have invalidated cache and restarted and cleaned the project, but I still get the same errors.
So what must I do to make the dependencies from the documentation work in order to be permit my users to sign in with Google?

79121996,How to Properly Format an IF Statement in My Code?,"I'm trying to write an IF statement in my code, but I'm not sure if I'm formatting it correctly. The structure I'm using is shown in the screenshot, but it seems incomplete or incorrect. Could someone guide me on the correct syntax or point out what might be missing? Any help would be appreciated!",VIM snippet (UltiSnips): pad line until column 80 reached with a character,"The code I often work at has a comment style like
#---------------------------------------------
# this is a comment
#---------------------------------------------
this.is_code()

I wanted to write a VIM snippet (using UltiSnips) that pads the comment box up until column number 80 (or better until vims colorcolumn). It should take the indentation level into account and always fill the dashes up until column 80.
I have a working snippet present that looks like this
snippet #
#`!p snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
# $1
#`!p snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
$0
endsnippet

Problem here is that when I start typing the number of dashes moves back. Because while I enter a comment the cursor I use in the snipept moves.
I think I need a pyhton or VIM variable that holdes the lines column from which I can subtract 80. But I can't find anything that works for this case.
Edit:
I've found one possible solution to avoid the moving dashes in the template by checking snip.c By checking for emptyness I can make sure that interpolation is done only once.
snippet #
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
# $1
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
$0
endsnippet

Unfortunately since I still have not found a replacement for using the current cursor position vim.current.window.cursor I get wrong lengths for snippets that have comments in indented blocks. For example:
snippet if
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
# if comment
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
IF( $1 )
   #`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
   # inside if
   #`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
   $0
   #`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`

I've decided to use such setup to mimic how the project is built on the CI system.
The project consists of a test executable E (it uses GoogleTest framework) and two static libraries, L1 and L2, having the following dependencies: L1 -> L2; L1, L2 -> E.
It is build using CMake system.
When building for code coverage, at the very beginning of the whole process I append to all targets the following compiler flags (CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS): -g --coverage -fPIC -O0 -fno-elide-constructors
Then, I generate code coverage report using the following command:
-- C:/msys64/mingw64/bin/gcovr.exe --html index.html --html-details -r <PROJECT_ROOT> --object-directory=<BUILD_DIR> --gcov-executable=llvm-cov gcov --merge-mode-functions=merge-use-line-min --exclude-unreachable-branches --exclude-function-lines --exclude-lines-by-pattern '^\s*\}?\s*$'
The first problem I've encountered is that for at least one source file some functions were found on multiple lines in the same file - what makes no sense to me, as e.g. gcovr reported one of such functions to start in L183 and L185, whereas it actually starts in L185 and L183 contains the closing brace of totally different function. I have no clue why I got this error, but managed to bypass it by using --merge-mode-functions=merge-use-line-min flag.
However, the resulting report is garbage. In particular, numerous empty lines as well as lines containing only comments/closing braces are marked as ""not hit"" what makes the output rather not useful.
Note that I've used --exclude-lines-by-pattern '^\s*\}?\s*$' flag, but for some reason it did not filter out the mentioned problematic lines.
Here is an excerpt from the generated report:

What should I do to make the results more accurate? Use different compiler/linker flags? A different coverage tool?
A different toolchain is not so feasible solution, as then I would have to constantly rebuild the whole project to switch between e.g. Clang <-> GCC.
I've tried to add -Xclang -fprofile-instrument=clang compiler flags to all build targets, but then the build process was stuck at linking my test executable E (or the process was slowed down, that I assumed it became staled; instead of completing let's say in 10-20 seconds, it did not finished even after a few minutes).

I have checked the Herd logs, and again, I can see the event broadcasting when I manually trigger with the Console Command, but no event is broadcasted when the job is processed on the queue.

The job to get the llm response is always successfully processed on the queue when the model is created
The LlmMessage model is always updated successfully by this job, and the response is stored

Can anyone provide guidance on properly setting up `react-native-fbsdk-next` with Expo?",Dynamic Configuration of Facebook Login with react-native-fbsdk-next in Expo,"I am using react-native-fbsdk-next with Expo to implement Facebook login. In order to configure this, I need to include certain settings in app.config.ts, as shown in the image below:

However, I want to avoid hardcoding these values directly in the configuration file. Instead of using environment variables, I would like to fetch these configurations dynamically from an API, allowing me to update them whenever necessary. Since app.config.ts is generated only at build time, is there a way to pass these configurations dynamically?
I came across a potential solution
  const setFBSDKSecrets = async () => {
      const res: SSOType = await API('/auth/get-credentials', {
        method: 'GET',
      })

      Settings.setAppID(res.facebook.clientId)
      Settings.setClientToken(res.facebook.clientToken)
      Settings.setAppName('myApp')
      Settings.setAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled(false)
      Settings.setAutoLogAppEventsEnabled(false)
    }

    setFBSDKSecrets()

I implemented this by adding the settings there and removing them from app.config.ts. However, when I ran yarn start, I encountered an error stating that the appID is missing:
Error: missing appID in the plugin properties

Can anyone provide solution on how to resolve this issue or suggest a better approach for dynamically configuring Facebook login settings in Expo?

I've confirmed that the `Toast` message displays, so the click event is being triggered. What could be causing the event not to log properly in Firebase Analytics?",Where can the logs reported by FirebaseCrashlytics.getInstance().log() and logEvent(...) be seen in the console?,"
As shown in the figure, where can the logs reported by calling FirebaseCrashlytics.getInstance().log() and FirebaseAnalytics.getInstance(getApplicationContext()).logEvent(..., ...) be seen in the console?
I can only see the automatically collected crash logs.

Any suggestions on how to style these elements effectively?",Why does the Bulma CSS framwork change the z-index on hover?,"I am looking into rendering performance issues of my website and I have found that I get a lot of repaints while just moving the mouse pointer around.
Example: the HTML-Box below the input field and button get a repaint each time I move the mouse pointer (hovering only) between the input and the button in this page (from the official Bulma docs)

I am using the Bulma CSS framework with an ""add-on""-arrangement on some elements. A deeper analysis has show that such buttons and inputs have their z-index changed on hover. The relevant scss code in Bulma is this:
From tools.scss:
  .#{iv.$class-prefix}button,
  .#{iv.$class-prefix}input,
  .#{iv.$class-prefix}select select {
    &:not([disabled]) {
      &:hover,
      &.#{iv.$class-prefix}is-hovered {
        z-index: 2;
      }

      &:focus,
      &.#{iv.$class-prefix}is-focused,
      &:active,
      &.#{iv.$class-prefix}is-active {
        z-index: 3;

        &:hover {
          z-index: 4;
        }
      }
    }
  }

What is the logic behind such a z-index change on hover?
It's causing a ton of repaints on my quite complex website. Do other CSS frameworks have a similar function? I am tempted to remove/neuter these z-index changes.

79139703,Unhandled Exception in Blazor WebAssembly: HTTP 403 Forbidden Error,"I'm encountering an unhandled exception in my Blazor WebAssembly application. The error message indicates a 403 Forbidden status code when trying to process an HTTP request. The stack trace points to an issue in the `Stickers.razor` file at line 110. I've checked my API permissions and everything seems correct. What could be causing this 403 error, and how can I resolve it to ensure successful HTTP requests?",How can I show an unauthorized view when HttpClient gets 403 from calling API in .NET Blazor Web Assembly?,"Basically here is my scenario that I'm going to achieve:

I have two users: A and B, A has the permission to access my Restful API developed with ASP.NET Core Web API, B doesn't have the permission to access that API resource (API will return 403)
In my Blazor Web Assembly app, there is a page which will read data from this Restful API, so, I would like when A user logs in, s/he can access this page correctly, but when B logs in, since B doesn't have the access to the API, therefore, when the page is loading and reading data from API, the page will get 403 error and should instead show something like ""You don't have permission to access the page""

So, in the OnInitializedAsync method of the Blazor page, it uses injected IHttpClientFactory to create an HttpClient, and makes a call to the API:
using var httpClient = HttpClientFactory.CreateClient(""stickersHttpClient"");
var httpResponseMessage = await httpClient.GetAsync($""api/stickers?page={pageNumber}&size={pageSize}"");
httpResponseMessage.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
var responseJson = await httpResponseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
PageContent = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<StickersPage>(responseJson);

If it is user B who opens this page, the httpClient.GetAsync will definitely return 403 error, but instead of showing a ""You don't have permission to view this page"" error on the page, the page actually reported an error in the console:

I have already applied @attribute [Authorize] on the page, and in the App.razor it has the following authorized view settings:
<CascadingAuthenticationState>
    <Router AppAssembly=""@typeof(App).Assembly"">
        <Found Context=""routeData"">
            <AuthorizeRouteView RouteData=""@routeData"" DefaultLayout=""@typeof(MainLayout)"">
                <NotAuthorized>
                    @if (context.User.Identity?.IsAuthenticated != true)
                    {
                        <RedirectToLogin />
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        <p role=""alert"">You don't have permission to view this page.</p>
                    }
                </NotAuthorized>
            </AuthorizeRouteView>
            <FocusOnNavigate RouteData=""@routeData"" Selector=""h1"" />
        </Found>
        <NotFound>
            <PageTitle>Not found</PageTitle>
            <LayoutView Layout=""@typeof(MainLayout)"">
                <p role=""alert"">Sorry, there's nothing at this address.</p>
            </LayoutView>
        </NotFound>
    </Router>
</CascadingAuthenticationState>

I think there should be some gap between the API and the page, there should be the way allowing my razor page to ""know"" about the 403 returned by the API so that it could apply the routed authentication view. But I don't know how can I do that.
(By the way, the authorization of the user is done against Keycloak with the policy based on user roles)

Here’s the error I get when I try to use ShadCN UI’s DropdownMenu component:
Module not found: Can't resolve '@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu'
Steps to Reproduce
Clone the latest Vercel Commerce template (Next.js 15).
Install ShadCN UI following the official documentation.
Import and try to use any ShadCN UI component, such as DropdownMenu.
The error appears, preventing the app from compiling.
What I’ve Tried
Removing node_modules and pnpm-lock.yaml, then reinstalling dependencies.
Testing ShadCN UI with a simple Next.js 15 project (without Vercel Commerce); it works fine.
Adding @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu directly to package.json, but it didn’t resolve the issue.
Environment

Next.js Version: 15.0.0-rc.1
Package Manager: pnpm
Vercel Commerce Template: Latest version after Next.js 15 update

Expected Behavior
ShadCN UI should work as expected with the Vercel Commerce template, just like it did with the previous version of Next.js
Question
Is this a known compatibility issue between Radix UI in ShadCN and Vercel Commerce’s dependency versions? If so, are there any workarounds, or will I need to modify dependencies manually to get these components working together?
Additional Info
I’ve noticed that Radix UI components are deeply embedded in ShadCN, which may be causing version conflicts in the Vercel Commerce template. Any guidance on resolving this conflict would be helpful

}

but I have to update to flutter 3.22, and with that my Google Sign In stop working, so I have to update the firebase_auth and firebase_core to avoid the Google Sign In problem, but when doing that, the geoflutterfire2 stop working, because it depends in an older firebase_auth and firebase_core package, geoflutterfire2 last update was 19 months ago, so I look for a new package and I found the Geoflutterfire_plus package, so I try to update my code but I'm blocked at this problem:
I need to make a query to get only the collection that meet this criteria:
  var collectionReference = firestore
      .collection(collectionRoute)
      .where(serviceCode, isEqualTo: true)
      .where('isActive', isEqualTo: true)
      .where('isVerified', isEqualTo: true);

but the problem is that in order to do the stream:
  Stream<List<DocumentSnapshot<Map<String, dynamic>>>> stream =
        GeoCollectionReference<Map<String, dynamic>>(collectionReference).subscribeWithin(
            center: center,
            radiusInKm: radius,
            field: field,
            geopointFrom: geopointFrom);

the collectionReference needs to be CollectionReference<Map<String, dynamic>>, so the error is at this:

79085902,Issue with PyMySQL Insert Not Committing Changes,"I'm trying to insert data into a MySQL database using PyMySQL in Python. The connection seems to be established correctly, and the SQL insert statement looks fine. However, when I run the script, the data doesn't appear in the database. I've used `conn_test.commit()` after executing the insert statement, but it still doesn't work. The script doesn't throw any errors, and I'm not sure what's going wrong. Any insights would be appreciated.

Here's a snippet of my code:

```python
import pymysql

conn_test = pymysql.connect(host='localhost', port=3306, user='root', passwd='****', db='pythonTest', autocommit=True)

with conn_test.cursor() as cursor:
    sql_insert = """"""
    INSERT INTO pythonTest.Members (ID, Name, Height, Weight) VALUES
    (1, 'Tony', 170, 56),
    (2, 'Dan', 167, 40),
    (3, 'Jack', 185, 83)
    """"""
    try:
        cursor.execute(sql_insert)
        conn_test.commit()
    except Exception as e:
        conn_test.rollback()
        print(e)

conn_test.close()
```

What could be causing the data not to commit to the database?",pymysql use commit still can't insert,"Even using the commit() with pymysql, insert statement has no effect.
Hi, this is my first time posting here, and I hope someone can solve my problem.
I am using VS2022 to compile the following code in a Python 3.12 environment:
import pymysql

conn_test = pymysql.connect(host='localhost', port=3306, user='root', passwd='****', charset='utf8', db='pythonTest', autocommit=True)

with conn_test.cursor() as cursor:
    1
    sql_insert = """"""
        INSERT INTO Members (Name, Height, Weight) VALUES
        ('Tony', 170, 56),
        ('Dawn', 167, 40),
        ('Jack', 185, 83);
    """"""
    cursor.execute(sql_insert)

    conn_test.commit()

conn_test.close()

I have already confirmed that the pymysql.connect command works correctly, and I have used it to create the 'members' table.
import pymysql

conn_test = pymysql.connect(host='localhost', port=3306, user='root', passwd='****', charset='utf8', db='pythonTest')

with  conn_test.cursor() as cursor:
    sql_create = """"""
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Members(
    ID int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    Name varchar(20),
    Height int(6),
    Weight int(6)
    );
    """"""

    cursor.execute(sql_create)

    conn_test.commit()

conn_test.close()

I can see that the 'members' table was created using MySQL Workbench, but no matter how many times I refresh or rerun the code, the 'members' table doesn't contain data like Tony and others.
Since I'm not very familiar with pymysql, I'm not sure where the problem is. Could anyone help me solve this issue?
===2024/10/19 Update===
Hello everyone, I’ve been dealing with other matters during this time, so I apologize for not responding earlier. Here’s an update with the current Insert statement code, along with an image of the execution result.
import pymysql

conn_test = pymysql.connect(host='localhost', port=3306, user='root', passwd='exagger2024SQL', charset='utf8', db='pythonTest', autocommit=True)

with conn_test.cursor() as cursor:
    1
    sql_insert = """"""
        INSERT INTO pythonTest.Members (ID, Name, Height, Weight) VALUES
        (1, 'Tony', 170, 56),
        (2, 'Dawn', 167, 40),
        (3, 'Jack', 185, 83)
    """"""
    try:
        cursor.execute(sql_insert)

        conn_test.commit()
    except Exception as e:
        conn_test.rollback()

        print(e);

conn_test.close()


As you can see, this piece of code doesn’t seem to show any errors, because if there were compilation errors, the 'try' and 'except' should have caught them, but they didn’t.
At the same time, the SQL database still doesn’t have any data like Tony and others.
Since I’m new to this, I’m feeling a bit lost. I really hope I can resolve this issue. In addition to continuing my research, I sincerely ask for your help. Thank you guys.

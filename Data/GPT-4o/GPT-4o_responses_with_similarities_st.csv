79041624,How to use switch branch button only seems to work for single repo in multi-root workspace,"I am used to looking at the source control checkout button in vscode as a quick indication of what branch the IDE thinks I'm working on.
This button is in lower left of the status panel as seen here:

When I have several folders open in a multi-root workspace, each with their own repo, this button only works for one of those repos - I can't figure out how to get it to show branch options for any of the other repos.
I've done all sorts of searches like ""vscode multi-root switch branch"", etc. Found nothing that addresses this.
Vscode documentation only address the use of this button in the context of single root repo.
I've also right clicked the branch in the scm view and selected ""make default"" - which didn't help.
How does vscode determine the repo in which to display the current branch?
How can I tell vscode which of the multi-root repos to use for display and actions?

The function is supposed to handle file conversion based on a given location and configuration, but it seems to be returning a resolved promise prematurely.

Here's the relevant part of the code:

```javascript
'use strict';

var path = require('path');
var fs = require('fs');
var plistParser = require('./plistParser');
var request = require('request');

function convertGrammar(location, extensionConfig) {
    extensionConfig.languageId = '';

    extensionConfig.languageScopeName = '';
    extensionConfig.languageExtensions = [];

    if (!location) {
        extensionConfig.languageContent = '';
        return Promise.resolve();
    }

    // Additional logic for processing the location
    // ...
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**
The function should process the `location` and update the `extensionConfig` object with the appropriate values before resolving the promise.

**Actual Behavior:**
The function returns a resolved promise immediately when `location` is falsy, which is expected, but it also seems to resolve prematurely in other cases, not allowing the processing logic to complete.

**What I've Tried:**
- Ensured that the `location` is valid and not falsy.
- Checked the asynchronous parts of the code (not shown here) to ensure they are correctly awaited or handled with promises.

**Questions:**
1. Could there be an issue with how I'm handling asynchronous operations within this function?
2. Are there best practices for ensuring that all asynchronous tasks complete before resolving a promise in Node.js?

Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!","<<Issue with Asynchronous Behavior in Node.js Function>>

I expect to receive a 200 OK status with the appropriate data when the request is successful.

**Actual Behavior:**
The response status is 200 OK, but the content indicates a 429 error, suggesting that I've exceeded the rate limit.

**Steps Taken:**
1. Verified the API key and authentication.
2. Checked the rate limit documentation for the API.
3. Implemented exponential backoff for retrying requests.

1. Why might there be a discrepancy between the HTTP status code and the content?

```
connection failed: connection to server at ""172.18.0.2"", port 5432 failed: fe_sendauth: no password supplied
```

**Expected Behavior:**
I expected to connect to the database successfully after entering the correct password.

**Actual Behavior:**
The connection fails with the error message above, indicating that no password was supplied.

**Steps Taken:**
1. I opened pgAdmin and navigated to the ""TestDB"" server.
2. I attempted to connect using the user ""root.""
3. I left the password field blank, as I assumed it might use a default or saved password.

**Environment:**
- pgAdmin version: [Your pgAdmin version]
- PostgreSQL version: [Your PostgreSQL version]
- Operating System: [Your OS]

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
- I verified that the server is running and accessible at the specified IP and port.
- I checked the pg_hba.conf file to ensure that the authentication method is set correctly.
- I attempted to connect using a different user with known credentials, which worked.

**Questions:**
1. Is there a way to configure pgAdmin to remember the password, or do I need to enter it every time?
2. Could there be an issue with the user ""root"" not having a password set, and how can I verify this?
3. Are there any additional settings in pgAdmin or PostgreSQL that I should check to resolve this issue?

Any guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!","<<Connection Failed: fe_sendauth: no password supplied in pgAdmin>>

The error message points to the following line in the `exceljs` module:

```
/Users/dariuszfranczak/Gits/Voly/ui-system-config/node_modules/exceljs/node_modules/uuid/dist/esm-browser/index.js:1
({""Object.<anonymous>"":function(module,exports,require,__dirname,__filename,jest){export { default as v1 } from './v1.js';
```

It seems like Jest is having trouble with the ES module syntax used in `exceljs`. I have already tried the following solutions:

1. Ensuring that my `jest.config.js` includes the `transformIgnorePatterns` option to handle ES modules.
2. Adding a `babel-jest` transformer to transpile ES modules.

However, none of these attempts have resolved the issue. 

**Expected Behavior:**
The tests should run without syntax errors, successfully importing and using the `ExcelJS` library.

**Actual Behavior:**
The tests fail with a `SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'` when trying to import `ExcelJS`.

**Environment:**
- Node.js version: 14.x
- Jest version: 27.x
- ExcelJS version: 4.x

Well I know that the purpose of the UnitTest is to run the test faster, I on the later codelab it stated that it's faster to mock / fake the repository and pass it to the viewModel rather than using context and instantiate the viewModel (which remove the AndroidJUnit4 test runner) and remove the roboelectric test that takes ages to run.

My question is that so does the Roboelectric fall into the Instrumented test (which belong to the AndroidTest folder) or the unitTest, because it seems I can't run the test because it hang indefinately.

Also my other question, is how to setup your physical device for instrument and end to end testing efficiently. In many cases, you need to install the app, activate the Display pop up windows while running background for each app and run the testing. Does there any alternative way of doing the instrument / end to end testing in the physical device?

- **Plugin**: `flutter_inappwebview` version 5.8.0

### Steps Taken:
1. Verified that all dependencies are up to date.
2. Cleaned the build using `flutter clean`.
3. Rebuilt the project using `flutter build ios`.

### Expected Behavior:
The app should build successfully and launch on the iPhone 16 simulator without any errors.

### Actual Behavior:
The build fails with the Swift compiler error mentioned above, preventing the app from launching.

### Request:
Has anyone encountered a similar issue with the `flutter_inappwebview` plugin or a similar setup? Any guidance on how to resolve this error would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!>>",Swift Compiler Error: Method Does Not Override Any Method from Its Superclass,"I'm encountering a Swift compiler error while trying to build my iOS app using Xcode.

flutter: Building meal card for: Salmon

**Expected Behavior:**
- Each meal card should display the corresponding image from the URL provided in the `imageUrl` field.

**Actual Behavior:**
- The `imageUrl` for some meals (e.g., ""Salmon"") is null, resulting in no image being displayed on the meal card.

**What I've Tried:**
- Verified that the image URLs are correctly stored in the backend.
- Checked the network requests to ensure the data is being fetched correctly.
- Ensured that the Firebase Storage rules allow read access.

**Questions:**
1. What could be causing the `imageUrl` to be null for some meals?
2. Are there any common pitfalls with Firebase Storage URLs that I might be overlooking?
3. How can I ensure that all meal cards have a valid image URL before building the UI?

I'm encountering an issue where the server process doesn't seem to shut down as expected during the unit test.

### Context

I'm using `pytest` with `pytest-asyncio` to test an asynchronous client that interacts with a server process. The server is supposed to be terminated after the test, but it appears to remain active, causing subsequent tests to fail.

Here's a snippet of the relevant code:

```python
class TestMultiprocessingTester:
    def server_process(self):
        server_process.terminate()
        if server_process.is_alive():
            server_process.kill()

        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert response.json()[""tasks""][0][""done""] is False
```

### Expected Behavior

- The server process should terminate after the `server_process()` method is called.
- The test should pass without leaving any active processes.

### Actual Behavior

- The server process remains active even after calling `terminate()` and `kill()`.
- The test hangs or subsequent tests fail due to the lingering process.

### Debugging Steps Taken

- Verified that `server_process.terminate()` and `server_process.kill()` are being called.
- Checked the process status using `is_alive()`, which returns `True` unexpectedly.
- Added logging to confirm that the shutdown warning is triggered.

### Environment

- Python version: 3.x
- pytest version: x.x

For the handleOnClick callback, I assigned the event in the callback the HTMLElement type from @types/react-dom because it is the parent of all possible HTML dom elements and was generic enough to satisfy TypeScript.
But, I now specifically need access to the event.currentTarget property.

The only way I know of to make TypeScript aware of the currentTarget property is to change HTMLElement to a more specific type, like HTMLButtonElement. But that breaks polymorphism because the developer could pick a tag like ""a"" which means I would need to change the callback event type to HTMLAnchorElement
Is there a generic React Typescript type for HTMLElement that accepts a tag string?  Like HTMLElement<'button'>. I'm just not aware of a generic type that can allow me to set the event conditionally based on an HTML tag name.

**Expected Behavior:**

The popup should appear below the dropdown menu without overlapping, allowing users to clearly see and select the options.

The code snippet below is part of the `detectChanges()` function, which is supposed to ensure that the view is refreshed if not already marked as dirty.

```javascript
detectChanges() {
    // Add `RefreshView` flag to ensure this view is refreshed if not already dirty.
    // `RefreshView` is used intentionally over `Dirty` because it gets cleared before
    // executing any of the actual refresh code while the `Dirty` flag doesn't get cleared
    // until the end of the refresh. Using `RefreshView` prevents creating a potential difference
    // in the state of the LViewFlags during template execution.
    this._lView[FLAGS] |= 1024; /* LViewFlags.RefreshView */
    detectChangesInternal(this._lView, this.notifyErrorHandler);
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**
The `RefreshView` flag should ensure that the view is refreshed correctly without any discrepancies in the state of `LViewFlags` during template execution.

**Actual Behavior:**
Despite setting the `RefreshView` flag, the view does not refresh as expected. It seems like the flag is not being applied correctly, or there might be an issue with the `detectChangesInternal` function.

**What I've Tried:**
- Verified that the `FLAGS` and `LViewFlags` are correctly defined and accessible.
- Checked the implementation of `detectChangesInternal` to ensure it processes the flags correctly.
- Ensured that no other parts of the code are interfering with the change detection process.

**Questions:**
1. Has anyone experienced similar issues with the `RefreshView` flag in Angular?
2. Are there any known bugs or workarounds related to this flag?
3. Could there be an issue with how `detectChangesInternal` is handling the flags?

All endpoints worked only delete endpoints not working. I'm working on Base Entity for my code readability:
package com.cloud.atlas.base.entity;

import lombok.Data;

import lombok.experimental.SuperBuilder;

import org.springframework.data.annotation.CreatedBy;

import org.springframework.data.jpa.domain.support.AuditingEntityListener;

import javax.persistence.*;

import java.io.Serializable;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

@SuperBuilder
@EntityListeners({ AuditingEntityListener.class })
@Data
@EqualsAndHashCode
@NoArgsConstructor
@ToString
@MappedSuperclass
public abstract class BaseEntity implements Serializable {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    @Column(name = ""id"", length = 50)
    protected Long id;

    @CreatedDate
    @Column(name = ""created_at"")
    protected LocalDateTime createdAt;

    @LastModifiedDate
    @Column(name = ""updated_at"")
    protected LocalDateTime updatedAt;

    @Column(name = ""deleted_at"")
    protected LocalDateTime deletedAt;

    @Column(name = ""is_active"", nullable = false)
    private boolean isActive = true;

    @Column(name = ""is_deleted"", nullable = false)
    private boolean isDeleted = false;

    @CreatedBy
    @Column(name = ""created_by"")
    private String createdBy;

    @LastModifiedBy
    @Column(name = ""updated_by"")
    private String updatedBy;

    @Version

    @PrePersist
    public void onCreate() {
        this.createdAt = LocalDateTime.now();
        this.updatedAt = LocalDateTime.now();
    }

    @PreUpdate
    public void onUpdate() {
        this.updatedAt = LocalDateTime.now();
    }

    public abstract <T extends BaseEntity> void update(T entity);
}

And Permission model:
@EqualsAndHashCode(callSuper = false)
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllArgsConstructor
@Getter
@Setter
@Entity
@Table(name = ""permission"")
@SQLDelete(sql = ""UPDATE permission SET is_deleted = true WHERE id=?"")
@Where(clause = ""is_deleted=false"")
public class Permission  extends BaseEntity {

    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String alias;
    @Column
    private String author;

    @Column
    private String title;
    @Column
    private String description;

    @Column
    private Integer status;

    @Override
    public <T extends BaseEntity> void update(T entity) {
        Permission permission = (Permission) entity;
        this.alias = permission.alias;
        this.title = permission.title;
        this.description = permission.description;
        this.status = permission.status;
        this.author = permission.author;
    }
}

Terminal Says:
nput: [100]
output: could not delete: [com.cloud.atlas.domain.Permission#100]; SQL [UPDATE permission SET is_deleted = true WHERE id=?]; nested exception is org.hibernate.exception.DataException: could not delete: [com.cloud.atlas.domain.Permission#100]
2024-10-03 10:33:16.710 ERROR 22188 --- [nio-9060-exec-3] GLOBAL_EXCEPTION_HANDLER                 : An error occurred

org.springframework.dao.DataIntegrityViolationException: could not delete: [com.cloud.atlas.domain.Permission#100]; SQL [UPDATE permission SET is_deleted = true WHERE id=?]; nested exception is org.hibernate.exception.DataException: could not delete: [com.cloud.atlas.domain.Permission#100]

When I researched this problem, the solution says if you are using a nullable command you need to use a length like this: @Column(nullable = false, length = 4096) and this does not solve my problem.
Wrong but If I can't solve I'm gonna add a Soft Delete endpoint with PUT annotation and just update is_deleted part to true.
Thank you for your help!
Edit: When I delete these lines problem is solved but delete is not soft anymore:
@SQLDelete(sql = ""UPDATE permission SET is_deleted = true WHERE id=?"")
@Where(clause = ""is_deleted=false"")

When I researched this problem, the solution says if you are using a nullable command you need to use a length like this: @Column(nullable = false, length = 4096) and this does not solve my problem.
Wrong but If I can't solve I'm gonna add a Soft Delete endpoint with PUT annotation and just update is_deleted part to true.
Thank you for your help!
Edit: When I delete these lines problem is solved but delete is not soft anymore:
@SQLDelete(sql = ""UPDATE permission SET is_deleted = true WHERE id=?"")
@Where(clause = ""is_deleted=false"")

The endpoint is `/api/v1/permission/{id}` and I'm passing an ID of `100`. However, I'm encountering a `500 Internal Server Error` with a `DataIntegrityViolationException`.

**Expected Behavior:**
The DELETE request should remove the permission with the specified ID from the database without any errors.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Open Swagger UI.
2. Navigate to the DELETE endpoint `/api/v1/permission/{id}`.
3. Enter `100` as the ID.
4. Click ""Execute"".

**Additional Information:**
- The application uses Hibernate for ORM.
- The database operation seems to be attempting an update rather than a delete, which might be related to a soft delete implementation.
- The error stack trace suggests a transaction issue.

**What I've Tried:**
- Verified that the ID exists in the database.
- Checked the database constraints and relationships for potential violations.
- Reviewed the service and repository layers for any misconfigurations.

**Questions:**
- Could this be related to a foreign key constraint or a cascading delete issue?
- How can I ensure that the DELETE operation is performed correctly without violating data integrity?

I've called the method transformToWebStream on the Body, to bypass the compilation error, but this time I'm getting an issue at runtime :

```

**Expected Behavior:**
I expect the `body` to be a stream that I can pass to `fileTypeFromStream` to determine the file type of the S3 object.

**Actual Behavior:**
The `body` is of type `StreamingBlobPayloadOutputTypes`, which seems to be incompatible with the expected `AnyWebByteStream` type required by `fileTypeFromStream`.

**What I've Tried:**
- Ensured that all AWS SDK and related packages are up to date.
- Checked the AWS SDK documentation for any changes in the `GetObjectCommand` response type.
- Attempted to cast the `body` to different stream types without success.

**Question:**
How can I correctly handle the stream from the S3 `GetObjectCommand` so that it is compatible with `fileTypeFromStream`? Is there a specific way to convert or cast the `StreamingBlobPayloadOutputTypes` to a compatible stream type?

Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated!","<<TypeScript Error: StreamingBlobPayloadOutputTypes Not Assignable to AnyWebByteStream>>

And finally the error, which occurs once dotnet is installed and the app is run from the server:

It says it can't find the npm run build command, which is not an issue I am seeing locally or when I run the app on a VM with Docker. I did see something similar when I had the wrong version of node installed when running the server but I don't know enough about Azure to troubleshoot.

```

### Context:
- **Project Type:** ASP.NET Core with a client-side component using npm.
- **Build Environment:** Oryx on a Linux-based system.
- **Node.js and npm:** Required for the client-side build process.

### Expected Behavior:
The build process should successfully execute `npm run build` as part of the client-side project build, resulting in a successful overall build.

### Actual Behavior:
The build fails with an error indicating that `npm` is not found, causing the `npm run build` command to exit with code 127.

### Steps Taken:
1. Verified that the ASP.NET Core project is correctly set up and builds locally without issues.
2. Ensured that the `package.json` file is present in the client-side project directory.
3. Checked the Oryx documentation for any specific configurations related to Node.js and npm.

### Request for Help:
- How can I ensure that `npm` is available during the Oryx build process?
- Are there specific configurations or environment variables I need to set for Oryx to recognize and use npm?
- Any insights into resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated.","<<Oryx Build Fails with ""npm run build"" Exited with Code 127 in ASP.NET Core Project>>

If I comment all references to the new package, and I simplify the API in order to return only a String (""Ciao""), the controller is fired. This is my tree directory

I have described everything in the previous section.

Hey guys i have the impression that the problem is in the mapstruct dependence importing.

The project structure seems correct, and the main application class is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`. However, when I try to run the application, it terminates immediately without any errors in the console.

Here's the setup:

- **IDE**: Eclipse
- **Java Version**: JDK 23.0.1
- **Spring Boot Version**: (not specified in the screenshot, assuming a compatible version)
- **Main Class**: `PaniECumpanaghiuApplication.java`

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(PaniECumpanaghiuApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**
The application should start and remain running, displaying the usual Spring Boot startup logs.

**Actual Behavior:**
The application starts and then immediately terminates without any error messages. The console shows some INFO logs, but nothing indicating a failure.

**What I've Tried:**
- Verified the `pom.xml` for any missing dependencies.
- Checked the `Run Configurations` in Eclipse to ensure the correct main class is selected.
- Cleaned and rebuilt the project.
- Ensured that the JDK is correctly configured in Eclipse.

**Additional Information:**
- The console output shows some Hibernate and Spring logs, but they don't indicate any errors.
- The project structure includes typical Spring Boot components like controllers, services, and repositories.

Any insights or suggestions on what might be causing this issue would be greatly appreciated!","<<Spring Boot Application Not Starting Properly in Eclipse IDE>>

### Error Details
- **Exception:** Unhandled exception at 0x00000005: Access violation reading location 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF.
- **Call Stack:**
  - `temp.exe!boost::dll::detail::library_function<void>::_cdecl(char)`
  - `temp.exe!boost::dll::detail::function::function_obj_invoker`
  - `temp.exe!main() Line 17`

### Expected Behavior
I expected the function to be successfully loaded and invoked without any exceptions.

### Actual Behavior
The program crashes with an access violation error when trying to read from an invalid memory location.

### Environment
- **Compiler:** MSVC
- **Boost Version:** 1.76.0
- **OS:** Windows 10

### What I've Tried
- Verified that the DLL is correctly placed in the expected directory.
- Checked the function signature to ensure it matches the expected parameters.
- Ensured that the Boost library is correctly linked in the project settings.

### Request for Help

- Verified that the `log` function works in other contexts.

        {
            console.log(""[CONTACT]"", ""Email déjà existant"");

            return NextResponse.json({message: ""Erreur de serveur"" }, {status : 500});
        }
    }
}

Below you'll see my db.ts file :
// In Pre-Production ⬇️

/* 
import { PrismaClient } from ""@prisma/client"";
declare global {var prisma: PrismaClient | undefined;};
export const db = globalThis.prisma || new PrismaClient();
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== ""production"") globalThis.prisma = db;
*/

// In production ⬇️

import { PrismaClient } from ""@prisma/client"";
export const db = new PrismaClient();

// Prisma Studio
// >>> npx prisma studio

I also include my schema.prisma file :
generator client {

}

datasource db {
  provider      = ""cockroachdb""
  url           = env(""DATABASE_URL"")
  relationMode  = ""prisma""
}

model Contact {
  email     String   @id @unique
  creation  DateTime @default(now())
}

To solve this issue, here is what I've tried so far :

I updated my code in db.ts file by adding the ""production"" part (which didn't work)
In the package.json file I added a postinstall command whithin the script section

""scripts"": {
    ""postinstall"": ""prisma generate""
  }

- Ensured that I included the necessary headers, such as `<cstdlib>`.

Can anyone suggest which package.json, angular.json and webpack.config.js configuration should be used to obfuscate Angular 18 project using javascript-obfuscator?
Are there any other options to obfuscate Angular 18 project code?

**Expected Behavior:**
- Decode the Base64 string and save it as a PDF file.
- The PDF should be readable and correctly formatted.

**Actual Behavior:**
- I'm able to decode the string, but the resulting PDF is either corrupted or unreadable.

**What I've Tried:**
- Used Python's `base64` library to decode the string.
- Attempted to write the decoded bytes directly to a file.

### Expected Behavior
I expect the console log to display the following:
- The text ""and now head field kicks in and now it stops:"" should be styled with `cssHeadField`.
- The text ""an error here, some more text with no for..."" should be styled with `cssError`.

### Actual Behavior
- The styling for `cssHeadField` seems to apply correctly, but it stops unexpectedly.
- The `cssError` styling is applied correctly, but the transition between styled and unstyled text is not smooth.

### Observations
- The issue seems to occur when transitioning between styled and unstyled text.
- The console log output is inconsistent, and the styling does not persist as expected.

### Environment
- Browser: Chrome

The error seems to originate from a WebAssembly translation issue, specifically when converting WAT (WebAssembly Text format). The line causing the problem is:

```javascript

```

### Context:
- **Project Structure**: The error is occurring in the `index.js` file located in the `web/javascripts/christmas` directory.
- **Build Tool**: I'm using Webpack to bundle my JavaScript files.
- **Expected Behavior**: The project should compile without errors, and the WebAssembly module should be correctly integrated.
- **Actual Behavior**: The build fails with the above error message, preventing the project from compiling.

### What I've Tried:
1. **Checked Webpack Configuration**: Ensured that the WebAssembly module is correctly configured in the Webpack config file.
2. **Updated Dependencies**: Made sure all dependencies, including WebAssembly-related ones, are up to date.
3. **Reviewed Code**: Double-checked the `index.js` file for syntax errors or issues that might cause this problem.

### Questions:
- Has anyone encountered a similar issue with WebAssembly in Webpack?
- Are there specific configurations or plugins required to handle WebAssembly modules that I might be missing?
- Could this be related to the version of Webpack or a specific loader?

","<<C# Azure Functions Project cannot load/find any assemblies>>
<<I have a Visual Studio project (.NET Core 8, Azure Functions v4) which ""works on any machine except mine"".
The error message is:

The '---' function is in error: Could not load file or assembly 'X.X.X, Version=8.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=...'. The system cannot find the file specified.

And it really makes no difference which package I import System.Net.Http, System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates - it can't find anything at all.
Depending on which code I comment out and remove imports the message is slightly different:

Other Azure Function projects work fine, but this one is ""stuck"".
Same issue in Visual Studio 2022 - Community or Professional.

Deleting entire Debug/Release Directories

The system cannot find the file specified""","I'm using Dependency Walker to troubleshoot a DLL issue in my application, and I'm encountering several errors related to missing dependencies. The tool is showing multiple entries with the message ""Error opening file. The system cannot find the file specified.""

### Context:
- **Tool**: Dependency Walker
- **Platform**: Windows
- **Target DLL**: FWPolicyIOMgr.dll (among others)

### Problem:
When I load my DLL into Dependency Walker, I see a list of missing dependencies, primarily starting with `EXT-MS-WIN-APPMODEL` and `API-MS-WIN-CORE`. These are marked with a yellow question mark, indicating that the system cannot find these files.

### Expected Behavior:
I expected Dependency Walker to confirm that all necessary dependencies are present and correctly linked, allowing my application to run without issues.

### Actual Behavior:
The tool reports that several DLLs are missing, which might be causing runtime errors in my application. The specific error message is: ""Error opening file. The system cannot find the file specified.""

### Steps Taken:
1. Verified that the application runs on a compatible version of Windows.
2. Checked the system PATH to ensure all directories containing necessary DLLs are included.
3. Attempted to manually locate the missing DLLs but was unsuccessful.

### Questions:
1. Are these `EXT-MS-WIN-APPMODEL` and `API-MS-WIN-CORE` DLLs critical for application execution, or are they optional?
2. How can I resolve these missing dependencies? Is there a way to obtain these DLLs, or should I adjust my application to avoid relying on them?
3. Could this be an issue with the version of Dependency Walker I'm using, and would updating it help?

**Expected Behavior:**
The items within the flex container should align horizontally and adjust their size proportionally as the viewport changes. The goal is to maintain a consistent layout across different screen sizes.

**Actual Behavior:**
The items are not aligning correctly. Instead of adjusting proportionally, they seem to overlap or misalign when the viewport is resized. This issue is particularly noticeable when the width is reduced below 500px.

**Code Context:**
Here's a simplified version of the relevant HTML and CSS:

```html

**Troubleshooting Steps Taken:**
1. Checked for any conflicting CSS rules that might affect the flex properties.
2. Verified that the HTML structure is correct and matches the CSS selectors.
3. Used browser developer tools to inspect the computed styles and layout.

**Questions:**
- Could there be a specific CSS property that I'm missing or misusing?
- Are there known issues with Flexbox in certain browsers that might cause this behavior?
- Any suggestions on how to ensure consistent alignment across different screen sizes?

I have a class `EraSendSessionCommand` that extends `BaseCommand`. The class is supposed to log errors when an exception is caught in the `execute` method. However, the errors are not being logged as expected.

Here's the relevant part of the code:

```csharp
using System;
using Serilog;

public class EraSendSessionCommand : BaseCommand
{
    private static readonly Serilog.ILogger m_Logger;

    public override void execute()
    {
        try

            GameMurkaCore.GameInstance.LeanplumAttribute();
        }
        catch (Exception e)
        {
            m_Logger.Error(""Error while sending session command: {Exception}"", e);
        }

        dispatchComplete(true);
    }
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**
When an exception occurs in `GameMurkaCore.GameInstance.LeanplumAttribute()`, the error should be logged by Serilog.

**Actual Behavior:**
No error messages are being logged. The `m_Logger.Error` call seems to be ignored.

**What I've Tried:**
1. Verified that Serilog is correctly configured in the application startup.
2. Checked that other parts of the application are logging correctly using Serilog.
3. Ensured that the `execute` method is being called and exceptions are being thrown.

**Questions:**
- Is there something wrong with how I'm using the `ILogger` in this context?
- Could there be an issue with the static initialization of `m_Logger`?
- Are there any common pitfalls with Serilog that I might be missing?

Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!","<<Serilog ILogger Not Logging Errors in C# Command Class>>

**Expected Behavior:**
The Ellipse should be centered within the MainWindow.

**Actual Behavior:**
The Ellipse is not centered and appears to be aligned towards the top-left corner of the window.

**What I've Tried:**
- Ensuring the `Width` and `Height` of the MainWindow are set correctly.
- Setting `WindowStartupLocation` to `CenterScreen`.

**Questions:**
1. How can I center the Ellipse within the MainWindow?
2. Is there a specific layout control I should use to achieve this?

<full-calendar [options]=""calendarOptions()"">
  <ng-template #eventContent let-arg>
    I am an event with {{ binding }} and {{ arg.event.title }}
  </ng-template>
</full-calendar>

My question: How actually this library makes it work? Fullcalendar in a nutshell is just a javascript library and I expect there is somewhere eventContent callback is called and this library does a trick by taking the template and creating a DOM element out of it. Can you tell me what technique is used for that? I can rephrase a question: how to dynamically generate a DOM Element, a template of which is managed by Angular. I even fine if change detection will not work automatically (it probably won't).
I pulled a source repo and it's content is very strange to me. I see how the eventContent is read from @contentChildren but nothing happens with it after.

The error message I'm getting is: ""Cannot read property 'eventContent' of undefined.""

Here's the relevant part of my `calendar.component.ts` file:

```typescript
import { Component, ContentChild, TemplateRef } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'full-calendar',
  templateUrl: './calendar.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./calendar.component.css']
})

  @ContentChild('eventContent', { static: true }) eventContent: TemplateRef<any>;
  @ContentChild('resourceLabelContent', { static: true }) resourceLabelContent: TemplateRef<any>;
  // Other @ContentChild declarations...

  constructor() {
    console.log(this.eventContent); // This logs 'undefined'
  }
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**
I expect `this.eventContent` to be initialized with the `TemplateRef` of the projected content when the component is initialized.

**Actual Behavior:**
`this.eventContent` is `undefined` when accessed in the constructor, leading to runtime errors.

**What I've Tried:**
- Ensured that the `eventContent` template reference is correctly provided in the parent component's template.
- Verified that the `@ContentChild` decorator is correctly used with the `static: true` option.
- Checked the Angular version compatibility for `@ContentChild`.

**Additional Information:**
- Angular version: 12.0.0
- The component is part of a larger calendar module.
- The error persists even after rebuilding the project.

Any insights or suggestions on how to resolve this issue would be greatly appreciated!","<<Angular Component Error: Cannot Read Property 'eventContent' of Undefined>>

BODY:
I'm using Visual Studio Code and trying to navigate through my find and replace history. I noticed there's an option that says ""Replace (↑↓ for history)"" in the find and replace input box, but I'm not sure how to use it effectively.

**Expected Behavior:**
I want to be able to quickly access my previous search and replace queries using the keyboard shortcuts mentioned.

**Actual Behavior:**
When I press the up or down arrow keys, it doesn't seem to navigate through my previous queries as expected. Instead, it moves the cursor within the input field.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Press `Ctrl + F` to open the find input box.
3. Enter a search term and replace it with something.
4. Try using the up and down arrow keys to navigate through the history.

**What I've Tried:**
- Restarting VS Code.
- Checking for any keybinding conflicts.
- Looking through the settings to see if there's an option to enable this feature.

**Additional Information:**
- I'm using the latest version of VS Code.
- This issue persists across different projects.

>>",['https://i.sstatic.net/7oNy7lGe.png'],React Must Be in Scope When Using JSX - ESLint Error,"I'm encountering an ESLint error in my React project that states: `'React' must be in scope when using JSX (react/react-in-jsx-scope)`. This error appears in my code editor, and I'm not sure how to resolve it.

Here's a snippet of the code where the error occurs:

```jsx
<Sider
  theme=""dark""
  className={styles.sidebar}
  trigger={null}
  collapsible
>
  {/* Other components */}
</Sider>
```

### Expected Behavior
I expect the code to compile without any ESLint errors, as I believe I have set up my project correctly.

### Actual Behavior
The ESLint error prevents the code from compiling, and it suggests that React must be in scope when using JSX.

### What I've Tried
- Ensured that `react` is installed in my `node_modules`.
- Checked my ESLint configuration to see if there are any missing rules or plugins.
- Verified that my `package.json` includes the correct version of React.

### Additional Context
- I'm using a modern React setup with functional components.
- The project is set up with Create React App, and I haven't ejected it.
- The error seems to be related to the use of JSX without explicitly importing React.

### Question
How can I resolve this ESLint error? Is there a specific configuration or import statement I need to add to my files? Any help would be appreciated!","<<React Must Be in Scope When Using JSX - ESLint Error>>

I expect the custom transition animations to work without any TypeScript errors.

**What I've Tried:**
- Double-checked the configuration objects to ensure they match the expected structure.
- Looked into the documentation for `@react-navigation/stack` to verify the `TransitionSpec` type requirements.

**Question:**
How can I resolve this TypeScript error? Is there a specific structure or type definition I need to adhere to for the `transitionSpec` in React Navigation? Any guidance or examples would be greatly appreciated.","<<TypeScript Error with TransitionSpec in React Navigation>>

**Actual Behavior:**
The error message indicates that `None` is not subscriptable, suggesting that `Foo.model_fields[k]` might be returning `None`.

**Additional Context:**
- `Foo` is a Pydantic model.
- `model_fields` is supposed to be a dictionary mapping field names to their metadata.
- I'm using Pylance in VSCode, which highlights the issue.

**What I've Tried:**
- Ensured that `kwargs` contains valid keys that match the fields in `model_fields`.
- Checked if `model_fields` is correctly initialized and populated.

The error occurs when I try to render a component, and it seems to be related to an infinite loop or excessive recursion.

### Error Details:
- **Error Message:** Maximum call stack size exceeded
- **File:** `bundle.js`
- **Line:** 175873:27
- **Function:** `Array.forEach` and `processConfig`

### Context:
The error appears in the console when I load a specific component in my application. The stack trace points to repeated calls to `Array.forEach` and `processConfig`, suggesting that there might be a recursive function or a loop that isn't terminating correctly.

### What I've Tried:
1. **Checked for Infinite Loops:** I reviewed my code for any obvious infinite loops but didn't find any.
2. **Component Structure:** I ensured that my component structure doesn't have circular dependencies.
3. **State Management:** I verified that my state updates are not causing unnecessary re-renders.

### Expected Behavior:
The component should render without causing a stack overflow, displaying the intended UI elements.

### Actual Behavior:
The application crashes with the ""Maximum call stack size exceeded"" error, and the component fails to render.

### Additional Information:
- **React Version:** 17.0.2
- **Development Environment:** Localhost on port 3002
- **Browser:** Chrome

### Request:
Could someone help me identify potential causes for this error and suggest ways to debug or fix it? Any insights into common pitfalls that lead to this issue in React applications would be greatly appreciated.","<<How to Fix ""Maximum Call Stack Size Exceeded"" Error in React Application?>>

### Expected Behavior

I expect that setting `""skipFeatureDeployment"": true` would allow the solution to be deployed tenant-wide without requiring individual site collection activation.

### Actual Behavior

Despite setting `""skipFeatureDeployment"": true`, the solution still requires activation on each site collection. This is not the expected behavior, and it's causing deployment issues across multiple site collections.

### Steps Taken

1. Verified the schema URL is correct.
2. Checked for any typos or syntax errors in the JSON file.
3. Rebuilt and redeployed the solution multiple times.
4. Ensured that the SharePoint tenant is updated to the latest version.

- Both queries show a Clustered Index Scan on the `PK_Genre` index.

Both queries are performing a full scan of the index, which is less efficient.

- The `IsDeleted` column is a `bit` type.
- The `LastEditDateTime` column is a `datetime` type.
- The primary key on the `Genre` table is `PK_Genre`.

Some additional context:

The extension uses Vite and React.
The error started appearing suddenly, and the extension was working fine previously.
I am not explicitly loading any external scripts apart from the ones within the extension.
My CSP currently allows 'self' and 'wasm-unsafe-eval' under script-src.
I've tried to debug this but can’t seem to pinpoint what might be causing this issue.

My questions:

What might be the cause of this error if nothing has changed in my extension?
How can I resolve the CSP issue to allow the script to load properly?

<<I've been working on a Chrome extension using Vite and React, and everything was working fine until recently. I haven't made any changes, but now I’m getting a Content Security Policy (CSP) error preventing a script from loading.
Here is the error message I'm getting in the console:
Refused to load the script 'chrome-extension://5216f022-cd78-49fc-abf9-9e362fc1640f/assets/content-script-preamble.js.js' 
because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: 
""script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval' 'inline-speculation-rules' http://localhost:* http://127.0.0.1:*"". 
Note that 'script-src-elem' was not explicitly set, so 'script-src' is used as a fallback.


Here is my manifest.json:
{
  ""manifest_version"": 3,
  ""name"": ""CRXJS React Vite Example"",
  ""version"": ""1.0.0"",
  ""action"": { ""default_title"": ""Tags New"", ""default_popup"": ""index.html"" },
  ""permissions"": [""storage"", ""webNavigation"", ""tabs"", ""scripting"", ""cookies"", ""activeTab""],
  ""background"": {
    ""service_worker"": ""src/background.js""
  },
  ""content_security_policy"": {
    ""extension_pages"": ""script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'; object-src 'self'""
  },
  ""content_scripts"": [
    {
      ""js"": [""src/content.jsx""],
      ""matches"": [""<all_urls>""],
      ""run_at"": ""document_idle""
    }
  ],
  ""host_permissions"": [
    ""http://localhost:3001/*"",
    ""https://tagdots.vercel.app/*""
  ],
  ""web_accessible_resources"": [
    {
      ""resources"": [""images/cursor-custom.png"", ""images/icon32.png""],
      ""matches"": [""<all_urls>""]
    }
  ],
  ""icons"": {
    ""16"": ""images/icon32.png"",
    ""32"": ""images/icon32.png"",
    ""48"": ""images/icon64.png"",
    ""128"": ""images/icon64.png""
  }
}

The error message seems to indicate that the script chrome-extension://5216f022-cd78-49fc-abf9-9e362fc1640f/assets/content-script-preamble.js.js is being blocked due to a violation of the CSP. However, I haven’t made any changes to the manifest or the code recently.
Some additional context:

The extension uses Vite and React.
The error started appearing suddenly, and the extension was working fine previously.
I am not explicitly loading any external scripts apart from the ones within the extension.
My CSP currently allows 'self' and 'wasm-unsafe-eval' under script-src.
I've tried to debug this but can’t seem to pinpoint what might be causing this issue.

My questions:

What might be the cause of this error if nothing has changed in my extension?
How can I resolve the CSP issue to allow the script to load properly?
Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

However, I'm encountering some issues with the project structure and build process.

### Project Structure:
- **BlazorApp2**: This is the server-side project.
  - Contains `Program.cs`, `appsettings.json`, and a `Dockerfile`.
  - Has a `Components` folder for shared components.
- **BlazorApp2.Client**: This is the client-side WebAssembly project.
  - Contains `Program.cs` and `_Imports.razor`.
  - Has a `Pages` folder for client-side pages.

### Problem:
When I try to run the solution, the client-side project does not seem to communicate properly with the server-side project. I suspect there might be an issue with how the projects are configured to interact with each other.

### Expected Behavior:
- The client-side project should be able to make API calls to the server-side project.
- Both projects should build and run without errors, allowing for seamless interaction.

### Actual Behavior:
- The client-side project fails to fetch data from the server-side project.
- There are build warnings related to dependencies not being found.

### What I've Tried:
1. Checked the `launchSettings.json` to ensure both projects are set to start.
2. Verified that the server project is running and accessible.
3. Ensured that CORS is configured correctly in the server project.

### Questions:
- Are there specific configurations needed in `Program.cs` for both projects to ensure proper communication?
- How should the `Dockerfile` be set up to support both projects if I want to containerize the application?
- Are there any common pitfalls with Blazor WebAssembly and Server project setups that I might be missing?

Any guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!","<<Issues with Blazor WebAssembly and Server Project Structure in Visual Studio>>

The request returns a `200 OK` status, but the response body is HTML instead of the expected JSON. The HTML seems to be a Laravel view. 

What could be causing this issue, and how can I ensure that the API returns a JSON response? Could this be related to the server configuration or the way the API is set up in Laravel? Any insights or troubleshooting steps would be appreciated.>>",0.49170882,0.81758344,0.79148793,0.37409264,0.6376263,0.5783603,0.36949295,0.70424443,0.63954973

The above code is rendering a users page of a NextJS application. The issue lies within the UserDetails commponent function,  which is fetching a user from the database, based on their user id. After fetching it is unable to access the props of the fetched data.

**What I've Tried:**
- Checked the API response in the network tab to ensure the data is being fetched correctly.
- Verified that the `user` object is not `null` or `undefined`.
- Tried accessing other properties like `user.first_name`, which also returns `undefined`.

**Questions:**
- Is there something I'm missing in how I'm accessing the properties?
- Could there be an issue with how the response is being parsed or handled in the code?

I expect the time data to be consistent across all rows, ideally in the format `HH:MM:SS` for both leg time and trip time.

The time data is currently in `MM:SS` format, which is causing issues when trying to perform calculations or display the data in a user-friendly format.

- Manually adjusting the time format in the CSV file, but this is not feasible for large datasets.
- Using Python's `pandas` library to read and process the CSV, but I'm unsure how to enforce a consistent time format.

**Question:**
How can I programmatically convert the time data to a consistent `HH:MM:SS` format using Python? Any suggestions or code snippets would be greatly appreciated.","<<CSV Parsing Issue: Inconsistent Time Format in Data>>

The function is supposed to take a callback and return a default value if the callback is not provided. Here's the relevant code snippet:

```typescript

**Error Message:**

```
Type '""default value"" | NonNullable<T>' is not assignable to type 'T'.
'T' could be instantiated with an arbitrary type which could be unrelated to '""default value"" | NonNullable<T>"".
```

**Expected Behavior:**

I expect the function to return the result of the callback if it's provided, or a default string value if it's not. The default value should be compatible with the generic type `T`.

**Actual Behavior:**

TypeScript throws an error because it cannot guarantee that the default string value is compatible with the generic type `T`.

I wanted to write a VIM snippet (using UltiSnips) that pads the comment box up until column number 80 (or better until vims colorcolumn). It should take the indentation level into account and always fill the dashes up until column 80.
I have a working snippet present that looks like this
snippet #

# $1
#`!p snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`

Problem here is that when I start typing the number of dashes moves back. Because while I enter a comment the cursor I use in the snipept moves.
I think I need a pyhton or VIM variable that holdes the lines column from which I can subtract 80. But I can't find anything that works for this case.
Edit:
I've found one possible solution to avoid the moving dashes in the template by checking snip.c By checking for emptyness I can make sure that interpolation is done only once.

#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`

#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`

Unfortunately since I still have not found a replacement for using the current cursor position vim.current.window.cursor I get wrong lengths for snippets that have comments in indented blocks. For example:

**Problem:**
When attempting to parse this JSON in my application, I'm encountering issues accessing the nested `campaigns` data. Specifically, I need to extract the `id` from the `campaigns` array, but my current approach is returning `undefined`.

**Expected Behavior:**
I expect to retrieve the `id` value `1208212259648659726` from the `campaigns` data array.

**Actual Behavior:**
The parsing function returns `undefined` for the `campaigns` `id`.

**Code Snippet:**
Here's the code I'm using to parse the JSON:

```javascript
const jsonData = /* JSON response above */;
const campaignId = jsonData.cells.data[0].campaigns.data[0].id;
console.log(campaignId);
```

**Request:**
Could someone help identify what might be going wrong with my parsing logic? Is there a better way to handle this nested structure in JavaScript?

The compiler throws an error indicating that `OwnedNavigationBuilder` does not have a method or property named `ComplexProperty`.

**What I've Tried:**
- Ensured that all necessary using directives are present.
- Checked the Entity Framework Core documentation to confirm the usage of `ComplexProperty`.
- Verified that my EF Core package is up to date.

**Questions:**
1. Is `ComplexProperty` a valid method in EF Core, or am I missing something in my configuration?
2. Are there alternative approaches to achieve similar functionality if `ComplexProperty` is not available?

Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!>>",'OwnedNavigationBuilder' does not contain a definition for 'ComplexProperty',"I'm trying to use the `ComplexProperty` method on an `OwnedNavigationBuilder` in my Entity Framework Core project, but I'm encountering the following error: `'OwnedNavigationBuilder' does not contain a definition for 'ComplexProperty'`.

I've decided to use such setup to mimic how the project is built on the CI system.
The project consists of a test executable E (it uses GoogleTest framework) and two static libraries, L1 and L2, having the following dependencies: L1 -> L2; L1, L2 -> E.
It is build using CMake system.
When building for code coverage, at the very beginning of the whole process I append to all targets the following compiler flags (CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS): -g --coverage -fPIC -O0 -fno-elide-constructors
Then, I generate code coverage report using the following command:
-- C:/msys64/mingw64/bin/gcovr.exe --html index.html --html-details -r <PROJECT_ROOT> --object-directory=<BUILD_DIR> --gcov-executable=llvm-cov gcov --merge-mode-functions=merge-use-line-min --exclude-unreachable-branches --exclude-function-lines --exclude-lines-by-pattern '^\s*\}?\s*$'
The first problem I've encountered is that for at least one source file some functions were found on multiple lines in the same file - what makes no sense to me, as e.g. gcovr reported one of such functions to start in L183 and L185, whereas it actually starts in L185 and L183 contains the closing brace of totally different function. I have no clue why I got this error, but managed to bypass it by using --merge-mode-functions=merge-use-line-min flag.
However, the resulting report is garbage. In particular, numerous empty lines as well as lines containing only comments/closing braces are marked as ""not hit"" what makes the output rather not useful.
Note that I've used --exclude-lines-by-pattern '^\s*\}?\s*$' flag, but for some reason it did not filter out the mentioned problematic lines.
Here is an excerpt from the generated report:

What should I do to make the results more accurate? Use different compiler/linker flags? A different coverage tool?
A different toolchain is not so feasible solution, as then I would have to constantly rebuild the whole project to switch between e.g. Clang <-> GCC.
I've tried to add -Xclang -fprofile-instrument=clang compiler flags to all build targets, but then the build process was stuck at linking my test executable E (or the process was slowed down, that I assumed it became staled; instead of completing let's say in 10-20 seconds, it did not finished even after a few minutes).

### Expected Behavior

The application should redirect to the specified URL without throwing an exception.

### Actual Behavior

Instead of redirecting, the application throws a `Swoole\ExitException`. This seems to be related to the `exit()` function call, which is not handled well by Swoole.

2. **Alternative Redirect Methods**: Attempted to use Laravel's redirect methods, but the integration requires the use of the OneLogin library's redirect function.
3. **Error Handling**: Wrapped the `exit()` call in a try-catch block, but the exception still propagates.

Here's the relevant code snippet:

```php
header('Pragma: no-cache');
header('Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate');
header('Location: ' . $url);
exit(); // This line causes the Swoole ExitException
```

I understand that Swoole handles PHP execution differently, and using `exit()` might not be compatible. How can I modify this code to work correctly with Swoole while maintaining the intended redirect functionality? Are there any best practices for handling such exceptions in a Swoole environment?

Any guidance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!>>",0.7428373,0.7900522,0.81483305,0.6424836,0.781614,0.8002719,0.6334462,0.7934885,0.8010144

1. How should I address the vulnerabilities in the SkiaSharp package while using LINQPad?
2. Is there a way to update or replace the package within LINQPad to ensure security?
3. Are there any best practices for handling such warnings in LINQPad?

Here's the context of my query:

```csharp
var aws = await DbContexts.AWSAsync();

The query retrieves a user from the AWS database context and lists the properties of the user object. The results are displayed correctly, but I'm concerned about the security implications of the warning.

- I expect to run the query without any security warnings.

I have checked the Herd logs, and again, I can see the event broadcasting when I manually trigger with the Console Command, but no event is broadcasted when the job is processed on the queue.
So:

The job to get the llm response is always successfully processed on the queue when the model is created
The LlmMessage model is always updated successfully by this job, and the response is stored
The LlmMessageUpdated event is broadcasted and the Livewire Component updated when a manual update is triggered
The LlmMessageUpdated event is not broadcasted and the Livewire Component is not updated when the job updates the model

Where am I going wrong?

The logs from the Reverb console show that events are being received and handled, but the expected behavior is not occurring on the client side.

### Context
I'm using Laravel Echo with Pusher to broadcast events. The server-side events are being triggered correctly, as shown in the logs. Here are some snippets from the log:

```

[1m    ""channel"": ""llm-thread-1""[0m
[1m}[0m
```

### Expected Behavior
When the `LlmMessageUpdated` event is broadcasted, the client subscribed to the `llm-thread-1` channel should update the UI accordingly. This includes displaying the updated message data.

### Actual Behavior
The client does not seem to receive the `LlmMessageUpdated` event, or it fails to process it correctly. The UI remains unchanged despite the logs indicating that the event was handled and broadcasted.

### What I've Tried
- Verified that the client is correctly subscribed to the `llm-thread-1` channel.
- Checked the Pusher credentials and configuration in both the Laravel and client-side setup.
- Ensured that the event class `LlmMessageUpdated` implements the `ShouldBroadcast` interface.

### Additional Information
- Laravel version: 8.x
- Echo version: 1.x
- Pusher version: 4.x

Any insights or suggestions on what might be causing this issue would be greatly appreciated!","<<Issues with Pusher Event Handling in Laravel Echo>>

1. Checked for any padding or margin issues that might affect alignment.
2. Verified that `justify-content` and `align-items` are set to `center`.
3. Tried using `align-self` on individual items, but the issue persists.

**Additional Context:**
The issue is more pronounced on larger screens, and I'm using Chrome's developer tools to inspect the layout. The HTML structure seems correct, and the CSS properties should theoretically center the content.

Any insights or suggestions on what might be causing this misalignment would be greatly appreciated!","<<CSS Flexbox Not Centering Content as Expected>>
<<I'm working on a digital art showcase website and I'm having trouble with centering content using CSS Flexbox. The page is supposed to display a series of images with captions centered both vertically and horizontally within their container. However, the content is not aligning as expected.

**Expected Behavior:**
The images and their captions should be perfectly centered within each section, regardless of the screen size.

**Actual Behavior:**
The images and captions are slightly off-center, especially noticeable on larger screens. It seems like the alignment is skewed to the top-left.

""createDate"":""2022-05-05"",
""createTime"":""12:00:00"", 


But the console in Eclipse prints
Ready to deserialize.
dietDiary:DietDiary [diaryId=2, userId=2, createDate=2021-12-26, createTime=00:00:00, totalFat=2.52, totalCarbon=2.3, totalProtein=2.1, totalFiber=2.1, totalSugar=1.2, totalSodium=1.1, totalCalories=1.21]

I don't know why?

The `createTime` should be in the format `HH:mm:ss` and should reflect the correct time based on the server's timezone settings.

**What I've Tried:**
- Checked the server's timezone settings to ensure they are correct.
- Verified that the database is storing the correct time values.
- Ensured that the API is correctly fetching and formatting the time data.

**Questions:**
1. Could this be an issue with how the time is being formatted in the API response?
2. Are there any common pitfalls with time formatting in JSON responses that I might be overlooking?

- Checked that `ngAfterContentInit` is the appropriate lifecycle hook for this operation.

What could be causing this error, and how can I resolve it?","<<Angular: Error with Optional Chaining and NativeElement in ngAfterContentInit>>
<<I'm working on an Angular component and encountering an issue with optional chaining and `nativeElement` in the `ngAfterContentInit` lifecycle hook. The code snippet is as follows:

```typescript
export class ContentComponent implements AfterContentInit {
  private navTitle = contentChild<ElementRef<HTMLElement>>('navbar');

  constructor() {
    console.log(this.headerTitleContent); // Access title element
  }

  ngAfterContentInit() {
    if (this.headerSubtitleContent()) {
      this.headerSubtitleContent()?.nativeElement.textContent = 'Enjoy a customized experience!';
    }
  }
}
```

The line with `this.headerSubtitleContent()?.nativeElement.textContent` is underlined, indicating an error. I'm using optional chaining to safely access `nativeElement`, but it seems there's an issue.

**Details:**
- Angular version: 12
- TypeScript version: 4.3
- The component is supposed to modify the text content of a subtitle element if it exists.

**What I've Tried:**
- Ensured `headerSubtitleContent` is correctly defined and returns an `ElementRef`.
- Checked that `ngAfterContentInit` is the appropriate lifecycle hook for this operation.

**Expected Behavior:**
- The calculator should accept valid integer inputs for the start and end values.
- It should evaluate the expression over the specified range and display the result.

**Actual Behavior:**
- The application displays ""Error - invalid input!"" when I enter valid integers for the start and end values.

**Troubleshooting Steps Taken:**
1. Verified that the inputs are indeed integers.
2. Checked for any exceptions thrown during parsing or evaluation.

**Questions:**
- Could there be an issue with how the inputs are being parsed or validated?
- Is there a better way to handle input validation to prevent this error?

**Expected Behavior:**
The code should create a new Excel workbook with two sheets, ""PipeSheet"" and ""EstruSheet"", and populate the first row of ""PipeSheet"" with values if the `pipes` condition is true.

**Actual Behavior:**
The application throws a `FileNotFoundException` related to the `System.Memory` assembly when attempting to instantiate `XLWorkbook`.

**What I've Tried:**
- Ensured that all NuGet packages are up to date.
- Checked the project references for any missing dependencies.
- Cleaned and rebuilt the solution.

**Environment:**
- Visual Studio 2019
- .NET Framework 4.7.2
- ClosedXML version 0.95.4

The `userGang` object is supposed to have `members` with defined `username` and `role` properties. However, they are showing as `undefined`. The rest of the `userGang` object seems to be populated correctly:

```javascript
Entire userGang object: 
{
  id: 31,
  name: ""elton john"",
  leader_id: 25,
  members: [{...}, {...}],
  user_id: 25
}
```

I've checked the data source and the properties should be populated. What could be causing these properties to be `undefined`? Could it be an issue with how I'm fetching or setting the data in my component? Any insights or troubleshooting steps would be appreciated.

Additional context:
- I'm using React with functional components.
- The data is fetched from an API and stored in a state variable.
- The issue persists even after refreshing the data.

79139703,How can I show an unauthorized view when HttpClient gets 403 from calling API in .NET Blazor Web Assembly?,"Basically here is my scenario that I'm going to achieve:

I have two users: A and B, A has the permission to access my Restful API developed with ASP.NET Core Web API, B doesn't have the permission to access that API resource (API will return 403)
In my Blazor Web Assembly app, there is a page which will read data from this Restful API, so, I would like when A user logs in, s/he can access this page correctly, but when B logs in, since B doesn't have the access to the API, therefore, when the page is loading and reading data from API, the page will get 403 error and should instead show something like ""You don't have permission to access the page""

So, in the OnInitializedAsync method of the Blazor page, it uses injected IHttpClientFactory to create an HttpClient, and makes a call to the API:
using var httpClient = HttpClientFactory.CreateClient(""stickersHttpClient"");
var httpResponseMessage = await httpClient.GetAsync($""api/stickers?page={pageNumber}&size={pageSize}"");
httpResponseMessage.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
var responseJson = await httpResponseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
PageContent = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<StickersPage>(responseJson);

If it is user B who opens this page, the httpClient.GetAsync will definitely return 403 error, but instead of showing a ""You don't have permission to view this page"" error on the page, the page actually reported an error in the console:

I have already applied @attribute [Authorize] on the page, and in the App.razor it has the following authorized view settings:

                    }

I think there should be some gap between the API and the page, there should be the way allowing my razor page to ""know"" about the 403 returned by the API so that it could apply the routed authentication view. But I don't know how can I do that.

So when I moved a copy of the codebase and opened the solution, VS asked for updating the codebase to .NET 4.8 and that's all updated. Once updating the codebase, session setting in web.config:
<system.web>
    <sessionState timeout=""40"" mode=""InProc""/>
    <compilation debug=""true"" targetFramework=""4.8""/>
    <httpRuntime targetFramework=""4.5""/>
</system.web>

The GetSession method has a line of code:
HttpContext.Current.Session.Contents[Parameter].ToString();

which now returns NULL and errors with

Object reference not set to an instance of an object

Code:
 public string GetSession(string Parameter)
 {
     try
     {
         return HttpContext.Current.Session.Contents[Parameter].ToString();
     }
     catch (Exception e)
     {
         return """";
     }
 }


The exact same codebase works perfectly fine in the old server with .NET framework 4.5.2. Any help on how to fix this?

UPDATE:
the getsession gets called in the page_load event of the master file:
protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{

    try
    {
        if (IsPostBack == false)
        {
            if (sss.GetSession(xxx_Session_Type.UserRole) != null)
            {
                UserRole();
            }
        }

        if (sss.GetSession(xxx_Session_Type.UserID) != """")
        {
            divLogin.Visible = true;
            lblWelcome.Text = sss.GetSession(xxx_Session_Type.UserName).ToString();
            //UpdateConfirmItSync();
        }
        else

**Actual Behavior:**
The application throws a `NullReferenceException` at the line where I attempt to access the session contents. The call stack indicates the issue occurs in the `GetSession` method.

**What I've Tried:**
- Ensured that the session is enabled in `web.config`.
- Checked if the session is being initialized properly in other parts of the application.
- Verified that the `Parameter` being passed is not null or empty.

**Expected Behavior:**
I expect `UseAuthUser` to return a user object that I can use within the `getResourceMenu` function.

**Actual Behavior:**
I'm getting a TypeScript error indicating that `UseAuthUser` is not being used correctly. The error message suggests that `UseAuthUser` might not be a function or is being used incorrectly.

**What I've Tried:**
- Checked if `UseAuthUser` is imported correctly.
- Verified that `UseAuthUser` is indeed a function in its module.
- Looked for any documentation or examples of `UseAuthUser` usage.

**Questions:**
1. Is there a specific way `UseAuthUser` should be used that I'm missing?
2. Could this be an issue with how `UseAuthUser` is exported or imported?
3. Are there any common pitfalls with using functions like `UseAuthUser` in TypeScript?

<<I'm working on an Electron application and using the `electron-updater` package to handle updates. I've encountered an issue where the `checkForUpdates` function does not seem to resolve as expected.

Here's the relevant section of the code from `AppUpdater.ts`:

```typescript
checkForUpdates(): Promise<UpdateCheckResult | null> {
    let checkForUpdatesPromise = this.checkForUpdatesPromise;
    if (checkForUpdatesPromise != null) {
        this._logger.info(""Checking for update (already in progress)"");
        return checkForUpdatesPromise;
    }

    const nullizePromise = () => (this.checkForUpdatesPromise = null);

    this._logger.info(""Checking for update"");
    checkForUpdatesPromise = this.doCheckForUpdates()
        .then(it => {
            nullizePromise();
            return it;
        })
        .catch((e: any) => {
            nullizePromise();
            this.emit(""error"", e, `Cannot check for updates: ${(e.stack || e).toString()}`);
            throw e;
        });

    return checkForUpdatesPromise;
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- The `checkForUpdates` function should resolve with an `UpdateCheckResult` or `null` after checking for updates.

**Actual Behavior:**
- The promise does not seem to resolve, and the application hangs when trying to check for updates.

**What I've Tried:**
- Verified that `doCheckForUpdates()` is correctly implemented and returns a promise.
- Checked the logs to ensure that the ""Checking for update"" message is logged, indicating that the function is being called.
- Ensured that there are no unhandled exceptions in the `doCheckForUpdates()` method.

**Questions:**
1. Could there be an issue with how the promise is being handled or resolved?
2. Are there any known issues with `electron-updater` that might cause this behavior?
3. Any suggestions on how to further debug this issue?

The test suite should run without syntax errors, and the imports should work as expected.

**Actual Behavior:**
The test suite fails with the above syntax error, indicating that the import statement is not recognized.

**What I've Tried:**
- Ensured that `""type"": ""module""` is set in `package.json`.
- Checked that all dependencies are correctly installed.
- Verified that the Node.js version supports ES modules.

**Questions:**
- How can I resolve this syntax error in Jest?
- Is there a specific Jest configuration needed for ES modules?

### Context

- **Next.js Version**: 15.0.0 (out of date)
- **Error Location**: 
  - `handleClientError` in `../src/client/components/react-dev-overlay/internal/helpers/use-error-handler.ts (25:13)`
  - `error` in `../src/client/components/globals/intercept-console-error.ts (19:27)`

### Potential Causes Listed

- Server/client branch using `if (typeof window !== 'undefined')`.
- Variable input like `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` changing each time.
- Date formatting in a user's locale that doesn't match the server.
- External changes to data without sending a snapshot with the HTML.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

### Expected vs. Actual Behavior

- **Expected**: The server-rendered HTML should match the client-rendered HTML to ensure proper hydration.
- **Actual**: The HTML rendered on the server does not match the client, causing the tree to be regenerated on the client side.

### Steps Taken

1. Checked for any server/client conditional logic that might cause discrepancies.
2. Reviewed components for any usage of non-deterministic functions like `Date.now()` or `Math.random()`.
3. Ensured consistent date formatting across server and client.
4. Verified HTML structure for any invalid nesting.

### Additional Information

The error message suggests that browser extensions might interfere with the HTML before React loads. I have disabled all extensions, but the issue persists.

ShadCN UI components worked without issues in the previous version, but now they throw a module resolution error related to Radix UI when imported
Here’s the error I get when I try to use ShadCN UI’s DropdownMenu component:
Module not found: Can't resolve '@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu'
Steps to Reproduce
Clone the latest Vercel Commerce template (Next.js 15).
Install ShadCN UI following the official documentation.
Import and try to use any ShadCN UI component, such as DropdownMenu.
The error appears, preventing the app from compiling.
What I’ve Tried
Removing node_modules and pnpm-lock.yaml, then reinstalling dependencies.
Testing ShadCN UI with a simple Next.js 15 project (without Vercel Commerce); it works fine.
Adding @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu directly to package.json, but it didn’t resolve the issue.
Environment

Vercel Commerce Template: Latest version after Next.js 15 update

Expected Behavior
ShadCN UI should work as expected with the Vercel Commerce template, just like it did with the previous version of Next.js
Question
Is this a known compatibility issue between Radix UI in ShadCN and Vercel Commerce’s dependency versions? If so, are there any workarounds, or will I need to modify dependencies manually to get these components working together?
Additional Info
I’ve noticed that Radix UI components are deeply embedded in ShadCN, which may be causing version conflicts in the Vercel Commerce template. Any guidance on resolving this conflict would be helpful

Hi, this is my first time posting here, and I hope someone can solve my problem.
I am using VS2022 to compile the following code in a Python 3.12 environment:
import pymysql

conn_test = pymysql.connect(host='localhost', port=3306, user='root', passwd='****', charset='utf8', db='pythonTest', autocommit=True)

with conn_test.cursor() as cursor:
    1
    sql_insert = """"""

        ('Jack', 185, 83);
    """"""
    cursor.execute(sql_insert)

    conn_test.commit()

conn_test.close()

I have already confirmed that the pymysql.connect command works correctly, and I have used it to create the 'members' table.
import pymysql

conn_test = pymysql.connect(host='localhost', port=3306, user='root', passwd='****', charset='utf8', db='pythonTest')

with  conn_test.cursor() as cursor:
    sql_create = """"""

    Weight int(6)
    );
    """"""

    cursor.execute(sql_create)

    conn_test.commit()

conn_test.close()

I can see that the 'members' table was created using MySQL Workbench, but no matter how many times I refresh or rerun the code, the 'members' table doesn't contain data like Tony and others.
Since I'm not very familiar with pymysql, I'm not sure where the problem is. Could anyone help me solve this issue?

Hello everyone, I’ve been dealing with other matters during this time, so I apologize for not responding earlier. Here’s an update with the current Insert statement code, along with an image of the execution result.

        (3, 'Jack', 185, 83)
    """"""
    try:
        cursor.execute(sql_insert)

        conn_test.commit()
    except Exception as e:
        conn_test.rollback()

        print(e);

conn_test.close()


As you can see, this piece of code doesn’t seem to show any errors, because if there were compilation errors, the 'try' and 'except' should have caught them, but they didn’t.
At the same time, the SQL database still doesn’t have any data like Tony and others.
Since I’m new to this, I’m feeling a bit lost. I really hope I can resolve this issue. In addition to continuing my research, I sincerely ask for your help. Thank you guys.

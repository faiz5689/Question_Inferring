79041624,How to Properly Use Promises in Node.js for File Operations?,"I'm working on a Node.js project using Visual Studio Code, and I'm trying to handle file operations with promises. In the `grammarConverter.js` file, I have a function `convertGrammar` that initializes some configuration properties and returns a resolved promise if a certain condition is met:

```javascript
function convertGrammar(location, extensionConfig) {
    extensionConfig.languageId = '';
    extensionConfig.languageName = '';
    extensionConfig.languageScopeName = '';
    extensionConfig.languageExtensions = [];

    if (!location) {
        extensionConfig.languageContent = '';
        return Promise.resolve();
    }
    // Additional logic here
}
```

I want to ensure that my use of promises is correct, especially when dealing with asynchronous file operations. What are the best practices for using promises in this context? Should I be using async/await instead? Any advice on structuring this function to handle potential errors effectively would be appreciated.",How to use switch branch button only seems to work for single repo in multi-root workspace,"I am used to looking at the source control checkout button in vscode as a quick indication of what branch the IDE thinks I'm working on.

When I have several folders open in a multi-root workspace, each with their own repo, this button only works for one of those repos - I can't figure out how to get it to show branch options for any of the other repos.
I've done all sorts of searches like ""vscode multi-root switch branch"", etc. Found nothing that addresses this.
Vscode documentation only address the use of this button in the context of single root repo.
I've also right clicked the branch in the scm view and selected ""make default"" - which didn't help.
How does vscode determine the repo in which to display the current branch?
How can I tell vscode which of the multi-root repos to use for display and actions?

79078823,How to Resolve JSONDecodeError in Node.js When Using Local Modules?,"I'm trying to perform a simple arithmetic operation using a local Node.js module. The task is to add 3 and 4, then multiply the result by 2. I'm using a local tool with `require` to import `add` and `multiply` functions.

The error message suggests that the function arguments are not valid JSON. I'm not sure why this is happening since I'm not explicitly dealing with JSON here. Could this be related to how I'm importing or using the functions? How can I resolve this error?

Despite this, the test runner doesn't seem to recognize `AndroidJUnit4`. The build output doesn't show any specific errors related to this, but the tests are not executing as expected.

What could be causing this issue, and how can I resolve it to successfully run my unit tests?",Run Roboelectric in Unit Testing and Most Efficient way to perform instrument test at physical device,"I'm doing some old codelab on testing here, But in the codelab it uses Roboelectric in UnitTest folder, but when I run that it stuck on this part

Here's the code.
@RunWith(AndroidJUnit4::class)
class TasksViewModelTest {

    // Subject under test
    private lateinit var tasksViewModel: TasksViewModel

    // Executes each task synchronously using Architecture Components.
    @get:Rule
    var instantExecutorRule = InstantTaskExecutorRule()

    @Before
    fun setupViewModel() {
        tasksViewModel = TasksViewModel(ApplicationProvider.getApplicationContext())
    }


    @Test
    fun addNewTask_setsNewTaskEvent() {

        // When adding a new task
        tasksViewModel.addNewTask()

        // Then the new task event is triggered
        val value = tasksViewModel.newTaskEvent.getOrAwaitValue()
        assertThat(
            value.getContentIfNotHandled(), (not(nullValue()))
        )
    }

    @Test
    fun getTasksAddViewVisible() {

        // When the filter type is ALL_TASKS
        tasksViewModel.setFiltering(TasksFilterType.ALL_TASKS)

        // Then the ""Add task"" action is visible
        assertThat(tasksViewModel.tasksAddViewVisible.getOrAwaitValue(), `is`(true))
    }

}

Well I know that the purpose of the UnitTest is to run the test faster, I on the later codelab it stated that it's faster to mock / fake the repository and pass it to the viewModel rather than using context and instantiate the viewModel (which remove the AndroidJUnit4 test runner) and remove the roboelectric test that takes ages to run.

My question is that so does the Roboelectric fall into the Instrumented test (which belong to the AndroidTest folder) or the unitTest, because it seems I can't run the test because it hang indefinately.

Also my other question, is how to setup your physical device for instrument and end to end testing efficiently. In many cases, you need to install the app, activate the Display pop up windows while running background for each app and run the testing. Does there any alternative way of doing the instrument / end to end testing in the physical device?


Thanks for reading this. And It will probably my reminder to doing testing in the future
I look up at some SO question about running test on physical device, but none of that are satisfy my question.

79047610,How to Properly Use Props in a React Component?,"I'm working on a React project and using a custom `<Avatar>` component. In the code, I'm trying to pass an `onClick` event and a `src` prop to the component. However, I'm not sure if I'm using the props correctly, as the IDE suggests several other props like `key`, `className`, `color`, `theme`, `alt`, `i18nIsDynamicList`, and `size`.

Here's the relevant part of my code:

```jsx
return (
  <Avatar as=""button"" onClick={() => console.log(1)} src={src} />
);
```

Could someone explain how to properly use these additional props? Are there any best practices for passing props to a custom component in React? Also, how can I ensure that I'm not missing any required props for the `<Avatar>` component? Any guidance or documentation references would be appreciated!",React. Autocomplete typing does not work when using ComponentPropsWithoutRef,"I use this structure to be able to use the Avatar as any ElementType
interface AvatarOwnProps {
    className?: string
    src?: string

    theme?: AvatarTheme
    size?: AvatarSize
}

type AvatarProps<T extends ElementType = 'div'> = {
    as?: T
} & ComponentPropsWithoutRef<T> & AvatarOwnProps

export const Avatar = memo(<T extends ElementType = 'div'>(props: AvatarProps<T>) => {

            <img src={initialSrc} alt={alt} />

    )
}


And when I try to use autocomplete, only my types (AvatarOwnProps) are displayed, but if I manually write for example onClick, TypeScript doesn't complain and everything works as it should.
It's not critical as I can still put in the attribute I want on my own, but could this be a problem in my code? I am using WebStorm to write the code

79097264,Why is my Python multiprocessing server process not terminating as expected?,"I'm working on a Python project using the `multiprocessing` module to manage server processes. I'm using VSCode for development and debugging. In my `TestMultiprocessingTester` class, I have a method `server_process` that is supposed to terminate a server process if it's still alive. However, the process doesn't seem to terminate as expected.

Here's the relevant part of my code:

```python
class TestMultiprocessingTester:
    def server_process(self):
        server_process.terminate()
        if server_process.is_alive():
            server_process.kill()
        logging.getLogger(""Process"").warning(""shut down server process"")
```

In the test method, I'm using `pytest` with `asyncio` to test the server:

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_client(self, server_process: mp.Process):
    await asyncio.sleep(10)
    url = ""http://localhost:5000/todo/api/v1.0/tasks""
    response = requests.get(url)
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()[""tasks""][0][""done""] is False
```

During debugging, I noticed that the `server_process` is marked as stopped with an exit code of `-SIGTERM`, but it seems like it's not fully terminating. The call stack shows the process is paused on a breakpoint.

What could be causing the server process to not terminate properly, and how can I ensure it shuts down as expected? Are there any specific considerations when using `terminate()` and `kill()` with `multiprocessing` in an async test environment?",Correctly tear down process when using pytest with multiprocessing,"I am working on a package that includes a server with the corresponding client.
I was thinking that I could save a lot of effort mocking all the interactions and just write some test cases that test both sides at the same time.
So I wrote a fixture that would yield a multiprocessing.Process instance inside which the server is running.
When the tests are done I tear down the process using process.terminate(). Unfortunately there is another ""orphaned"" process that I can't seem to get a handle on.
How do I remove the other process or how do I avoid starting it in the first place?
If you know of a way of doing this with a different library than multiprocessing I am totally open to it.
To reproduce the problem I used the code from how-to-make-a-simple-python-rest-server-and-client to create a simple Rest Server/Client Pair.

}) as <E extends ElementType = 'div'>(props: BoxProps<E>) => JSX.Element;

For the handleOnClick callback, I assigned the event in the callback the HTMLElement type from @types/react-dom because it is the parent of all possible HTML dom elements and was generic enough to satisfy TypeScript.
But, I now specifically need access to the event.currentTarget property.

The only way I know of to make TypeScript aware of the currentTarget property is to change HTMLElement to a more specific type, like HTMLButtonElement. But that breaks polymorphism because the developer could pick a tag like ""a"" which means I would need to change the callback event type to HTMLAnchorElement
Is there a generic React Typescript type for HTMLElement that accepts a tag string?  Like HTMLElement<'button'>. I'm just not aware of a generic type that can allow me to set the event conditionally based on an HTML tag name.

Here's the relevant HTML snippet:

The popup is currently positioned with inline styles, but I need to adjust its position dynamically based on user interactions or window resizing.

Any advice on best practices for handling this kind of UI adjustment would be appreciated.",Kendo UI for Angular - filterable DropDownList - Search icon misaligned,"I have the following code:

The built-in Search icon is misaligned (see screenshot below). It was ok before.

The screenshot also shows the automatic kendo-popup tag in the Browser Developer tools, seen when a user clicks in Choose Document Type dropdown. As this popup is very dynamic, I can't inspect further the Search icon in Developer Tools to see the automatic Kendo HTML tags and CSS classes so that I can potentially override a CSS class related to the icon.
How can I align the Search icon properly (to be at the beginning of the input field and vertically seen fully)?

79125244,How to Properly Use the RefreshView Flag in Angular's detectChanges Method?,"I'm working with Angular and came across the `detectChanges()` method in the codebase. The method uses a `RefreshView` flag to ensure the view is refreshed if not already dirty. Here's the relevant code snippet:

```javascript
detectChanges() {
  // Add `RefreshView` flag to ensure this view is refreshed if not already dirty.
  // `RefreshView` is used intentionally over `Dirty` because it gets cleared before
  // executing any of the actual refresh code while the `Dirty` flag doesn't get cleared
  // until the end of the refresh. Using `RefreshView` prevents creating a potential difference
  // in the state of the LViewFlags during template execution.
  this._lView[FLAGS] |= 1024; /* LViewFlags.RefreshView */
  detectChangesInternal(this._lView, this.notifyErrorHandler);
}
```

I understand that the `RefreshView` flag is used to avoid potential state differences during template execution. However, I'm not entirely sure about the implications of using this flag over the `Dirty` flag. Could someone explain the differences between these flags and when it's appropriate to use `RefreshView`? Additionally, are there any potential pitfalls or best practices I should be aware of when using this approach in Angular?",Angular not calling the detectChanges() method on button click (change detection),"I have added a breakpoint in the angular source code on the detectChanges() method:

It seems like there's a constraint preventing the deletion. The stack trace suggests an issue with Hibernate and transaction management. Here are some details:

- The API is running on `localhost:9060`.
- The DELETE request is authenticated with a Bearer token.
- The database operation is trying to update the `is_deleted` field instead of performing a hard delete.

When I researched this problem, the solution says if you are using a nullable command you need to use a length like this: @Column(nullable = false, length = 4096) and this does not solve my problem.
Wrong but If I can't solve I'm gonna add a Soft Delete endpoint with PUT annotation and just update is_deleted part to true.
Thank you for your help!
Edit: When I delete these lines problem is solved but delete is not soft anymore:
@SQLDelete(sql = ""UPDATE permission SET is_deleted = true WHERE id=?"")
@Where(clause = ""is_deleted=false"")

The build logs indicate that the issue occurs when trying to run `npm run build` for the client project. It seems like the npm command is not found, which is causing the build to fail.

The main class `PaniECumpanaghiuApplication` is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, and I am using JDK 23.0.1. The console shows no error messages, but the application terminates immediately after starting.

Here is the main class code:

```java

- The `pom.xml` file seems correctly configured for a Spring Boot application.
- The JDK is properly set in Eclipse.
- There are no apparent errors in the Problems tab.

What could be causing the application to terminate immediately without any error messages? Are there specific logs or configurations I should check to diagnose this issue?",Adding a new package broke my Spring Boot Application,"I'm getting troubles since I have added a new package in my spring boot application containing Mapstructs' mappers. Looks like the field:
@Autowired    
private UtenteMapper utenteMapper;

@SpringBootApplication    
@ComponentScan(""PaniECumpanagghiu.PaniECumpanagghiu.Mappers"")

In this way the functionality is being recovered, but the @Controller is not fired (when I invoke my API the server retrieves 404). I tried also to add all the packages into the annotation @ComponentScan, like this
@ComponentScan(""PaniECumpanagghiu.PaniECumpanagghiu.Mappers"",""PaniECumpanagghiu.PaniECumpanagghiu.controller"",...)
In this way neither the former object, UtenteMapper, is populated anymore (same behavior than the case without @ComponentScan annotation).
If I comment all references to the new package, and I simplify the API in order to return only a String (""Ciao""), the controller is fired. This is my tree directory

I have described everything in the previous section.

79090291,Access Violation Error When Using Boost DLL in C++,"I'm encountering an access violation error while using the Boost DLL library in my C++ project. The error message is:

```
Exception has occurred: W32/0xC0000005
Unhandled exception at 0x00007FF777B713C3 in tmp.exe: 0xC0000005: Access violation reading location 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF.
```

The error occurs in the following context:

- I'm using Boost's DLL library to import a function.
- The error seems to be related to the `static_cast` operation in the `operator()` function within the `boost::dll` namespace.
- The call stack shows the error happening during a function call involving `boost::dll::detail::library_function<void>`.

Here is a snippet of the relevant code:

```cpp
namespace boost { namespace dll {
    class library_function {
        // ...
        inline auto operator()(Args&&... args) const
            -> decltype((*f_)(static_cast<Args&&>(args)...)) {
            return (*f_)(static_cast<Args&&>(args)...);
        }
    };
}}
```

I've ensured that the function signature matches the expected parameters, but the error persists. I'm using Visual Studio as my IDE.

Could this be a problem with how I'm handling the function pointer or the arguments? What steps can I take to resolve this access violation error? Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",Access Violation exception when calling DLL function loaded with boost import_alias,"I am trying to call a function from a DLL.

However, it is failing on the call of the constructFunc, throwing an error at the following code in boost/dll/import.hpp:
        // Compilation error at this point means that imported function
        // was called with unmatching parameters.

79126371,TypeScript Error: Conflicting Type Declarations for Event Type,"I'm working on a TypeScript project and encountered an issue with conflicting type declarations for `e.type`. The IDE suggests two possible declarations:

1. `keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap` from a custom `global.d.ts` file.
2. `string` from the standard TypeScript DOM library.

The code snippet causing the issue is:

```typescript
console.log(e.type);
```

It seems like there's a conflict between a custom type definition and the default TypeScript DOM types. How can I resolve this conflict to ensure the correct type is used? Is there a way to prioritize one declaration over the other, or should I modify the custom type definitions? Any guidance on best practices for handling such conflicts would be appreciated.",Override (reintroduce) property with typescript declaration merging,"The base/built-in declaration of Event and GlobalEventHandlersEventMap looks like so:
// lib.dom.d.ts

interface Event {
    /**
     * Returns the type of event, e.g. ""click"", ""hashchange"", or ""submit"".
     */
    readonly type: string;   // <-- note this part
}

interface GlobalEventHandlersEventMap {
    click: MouseEvent;
    //... all sorts of other built in events...
}

Let's say I define an EventTriggered whose constructor has a parameter containing one of the properties named in GlobalEventHandlersEventMap:
class EventTriggered {
    constructor(
        readonly eventName: keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap
    ) {}
}

This means that the following works because there is a property named 'click':
new EventTriggered('click');

But the following will not work (this is ok and intended):
new EventTriggered('some-random-string');

Now I want to use this class inside an event listener, like so:
function onClick(event: Event): void {
    new EventTriggered(event.type);
}

This will fail because as in the first example, event.type contains ""any string"". Type casting could be one way of solving this:
function onClick(event: Event): void {
    new EventTriggered(event.type as keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap);
}

BUT in my opinion, the original declaration of type is wrong - it should not be string, but keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap.
I tried doing that with declaration merging:
// global.d.ts
interface Event {
    readonly type: keyof GlobalEventHandlersEventMap;
}

What happens then is that the previous error still shows up, but now my IDE shows that type has two declarations:


I also saw this question, but it feels different - for one thing, I'm not getting the same error as that one: TypeScript declaration merging - changing a property type

However, I'm not sure if I've set everything up correctly. The application doesn't seem to connect, and I'm not receiving any debug information.

The generated swagger entry point looks like this now:

Where all the inner classes of my main class are represented by strings. If we just take a look at the first Property (IDFactura), this is the code generated by wsdltophp

     * @OA\Property()
     */
    protected ?\App\Application\ServiceReferences\Verifactu\StructType\IDFacturaExpedidaType $IDFactura = null;

(The @OA\Schema is also generated by wsdltophp) But it's clear that my SwaggerUI is representing this inner class like a simple string.
Since this WSDL is external and I have no control over it, nor the wsdltophp generated code, I'm looking for a solution which would avoid updating/modifying those external classes

79087767,Type Hinting Issue with Generic Class Method in Python,"I'm working with Python's type hinting and generics, and I'm encountering an issue with a method in a generic class. Here's a simplified version of my code:

```python
from typing import TypeVar, Generic, List, Any

X = TypeVar('X')

class Y(Generic[X]):
    type Z = List[X]

    def a(self, x: X) -> Z:
        return [x]

b: List[Any] = Y[int]().a(x=2)
```

The method `a` is supposed to return a list of type `Z`, which is defined as `List[X]`. However, I'm not sure if the return type is correctly specified, and I'm getting type hinting errors in my IDE.

Could someone explain how to properly use type hinting with generics in this context? Is there a better way to define the return type of the method `a`? Any help would be appreciated!",Use typealias defined inside generic class in method signature,"Given a generic class, one might have multiple methods which use a deduced type in their signature. To avoid repetition I would like to define a typealias. What is the best way to access it in a method signature?
class Y[X]:
    type Z = list[X]

    # this one works
    def works_with_pyright_but_ugly(self) -> ""Y[X].Z"":
        return []

    # these do not work
    def what_is_Y(self) -> Y[X].Z:
        return []

    def self_has_no_member_z(self) -> Self.Z:
        return []

    def what_is_z(self) -> Z:
        return []

    def listify(self, value: X) -> Z:
        """"""Just to show a slighlty more meaningful funciton""""""
        return [value]

Is there a better way to reference Z in the method signatures?
In my view, what_is_z and listify do not work, because my editor does not list the value of the variable in the following example as list[int] as I would expect. Half the reason of type annotations for me is convenience in the editor (the other half being error checking).

79079676,"Angular Component Error: ""Everything above isn't related to actual logic""","I'm working on an Angular project using Visual Studio Code, and I'm encountering an issue in my `full-calendar.component.ts` file. The error message states, ""Everything above isn't related to actual logic,"" which seems to be a comment rather than an error. However, I'm unsure how to proceed with resolving the actual problem.

Here are some details about the setup:

- The component is decorated with `@Component` and uses `@ContentChild` decorators extensively.
- The error seems to be related to the `eventContent` template reference.
- The project uses Angular, and the component is part of a calendar module.
- The terminal shows some warnings about vulnerabilities, but they don't seem directly related to this issue.

What could be causing this issue, and how can I resolve it? Is there something specific I should check in the component's logic or configuration? Any guidance on troubleshooting this would be appreciated.",Fullcalendar Angular. How is the eventContent Angular template actually rendered in FullCalendar?,"Fullcalendar supports an eventContent and numerous other callbacks letting us to define custom templates for event UI and etc...
There is a wrapper library called @fullcalendar/angular, it provides a way to define custom event template in angular style and it renders into the correct spot the calendar.
<full-calendar [options]=""calendarOptions()"">
  <ng-template #eventContent let-arg>
    I am an event with {{ binding }} and {{ arg.event.title }}
  </ng-template>
</full-calendar>

My question: How actually this library makes it work? Fullcalendar in a nutshell is just a javascript library and I expect there is somewhere eventContent callback is called and this library does a trick by taking the template and creating a DOM element out of it. Can you tell me what technique is used for that? I can rephrase a question: how to dynamically generate a DOM Element, a template of which is managed by Angular. I even fine if change detection will not work automatically (it probably won't).
I pulled a source repo and it's content is very strange to me. I see how the eventContent is read from @contentChildren but nothing happens with it after.

  ""postinstall"": ""rm -rf node_modules/@types/glob""

instead what I did was modify the start to SET NODE_ENV=development && eleventy --serve and remove the postinstall to actually run the program.
Also I'm using nvm-windows to manage my node versions. node -v and nvm -v won't run on linux but npm -v does. See image below: (It runs normally on cmd)

Can anyone help to explain. To my knowledge both windows and linux should run inside wsl.

The error message seems to indicate that the script chrome-extension://5216f022-cd78-49fc-abf9-9e362fc1640f/assets/content-script-preamble.js.js is being blocked due to a violation of the CSP. However, I haven’t made any changes to the manifest or the code recently.
Some additional context:

The extension uses Vite and React.
The error started appearing suddenly, and the extension was working fine previously.
I am not explicitly loading any external scripts apart from the ones within the extension.
My CSP currently allows 'self' and 'wasm-unsafe-eval' under script-src.
I've tried to debug this but can’t seem to pinpoint what might be causing this issue.

My questions:

What might be the cause of this error if nothing has changed in my extension?
How can I resolve the CSP issue to allow the script to load properly?
Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

The `BlazorApp2` project seems to be the server-side component, while `BlazorApp2.Client` is the client-side component. 

Here are the details of my setup:

- **BlazorApp2**:
  - Contains `Program.cs`, `appsettings.json`, and a `Dockerfile`.
  - Has a `Components` folder and a `wwwroot` directory.

- **BlazorApp2.Client**:
  - Contains `Program.cs` and `_Imports.razor`.
  - Has a `Pages` folder and a `wwwroot` directory.

I am unsure about the correct configuration for these projects to work together seamlessly. Specifically, I need guidance on:

1. How to configure the `Program.cs` files in both projects to ensure proper communication between the server and client.
2. Any necessary changes in `appsettings.json` for environment-specific settings.
3. How to set up the Dockerfile for deployment if needed.

What are the common pitfalls I should avoid, and are there specific language rules I need to follow? Any guidance or examples would be greatly appreciated!",VIM snippet (UltiSnips): pad line until column 80 reached with a character,"The code I often work at has a comment style like
#---------------------------------------------
# this is a comment
#---------------------------------------------
this.is_code()

I wanted to write a VIM snippet (using UltiSnips) that pads the comment box up until column number 80 (or better until vims colorcolumn). It should take the indentation level into account and always fill the dashes up until column 80.
I have a working snippet present that looks like this
snippet #
#`!p snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
# $1
#`!p snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
$0
endsnippet

Problem here is that when I start typing the number of dashes moves back. Because while I enter a comment the cursor I use in the snipept moves.
I think I need a pyhton or VIM variable that holdes the lines column from which I can subtract 80. But I can't find anything that works for this case.
Edit:
I've found one possible solution to avoid the moving dashes in the template by checking snip.c By checking for emptyness I can make sure that interpolation is done only once.
snippet #
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
# $1
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
$0
endsnippet

Unfortunately since I still have not found a replacement for using the current cursor position vim.current.window.cursor I get wrong lengths for snippets that have comments in indented blocks. For example:
snippet if
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
# if comment
#`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
IF( $1 )
   #`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
   # inside if
   #`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`
   $0
   #`!p if snip.c == """": snip.rv = '-' * (80 - vim.current.window.cursor[1])`

Here's the relevant part of my code:

```cpp

I've decided to use such setup to mimic how the project is built on the CI system.
The project consists of a test executable E (it uses GoogleTest framework) and two static libraries, L1 and L2, having the following dependencies: L1 -> L2; L1, L2 -> E.
It is build using CMake system.
When building for code coverage, at the very beginning of the whole process I append to all targets the following compiler flags (CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS): -g --coverage -fPIC -O0 -fno-elide-constructors
Then, I generate code coverage report using the following command:
-- C:/msys64/mingw64/bin/gcovr.exe --html index.html --html-details -r <PROJECT_ROOT> --object-directory=<BUILD_DIR> --gcov-executable=llvm-cov gcov --merge-mode-functions=merge-use-line-min --exclude-unreachable-branches --exclude-function-lines --exclude-lines-by-pattern '^\s*\}?\s*$'
The first problem I've encountered is that for at least one source file some functions were found on multiple lines in the same file - what makes no sense to me, as e.g. gcovr reported one of such functions to start in L183 and L185, whereas it actually starts in L185 and L183 contains the closing brace of totally different function. I have no clue why I got this error, but managed to bypass it by using --merge-mode-functions=merge-use-line-min flag.
However, the resulting report is garbage. In particular, numerous empty lines as well as lines containing only comments/closing braces are marked as ""not hit"" what makes the output rather not useful.
Note that I've used --exclude-lines-by-pattern '^\s*\}?\s*$' flag, but for some reason it did not filter out the mentioned problematic lines.
Here is an excerpt from the generated report:

What should I do to make the results more accurate? Use different compiler/linker flags? A different coverage tool?
A different toolchain is not so feasible solution, as then I would have to constantly rebuild the whole project to switch between e.g. Clang <-> GCC.
I've tried to add -Xclang -fprofile-instrument=clang compiler flags to all build targets, but then the build process was stuck at linking my test executable E (or the process was slowed down, that I assumed it became staled; instead of completing let's say in 10-20 seconds, it did not finished even after a few minutes).

Build services have ""Read and Contribute"" permissions set to ""Allow"" in both repositories.
Both Repo A and Repo B are part of the same project.

Why is the pipeline not triggering automatically, and how can I ensure it runs whenever a commit is pushed to Repo B?

function createServer<typeof http.IncomingMessage, typeof http.ServerResponse>(requestListener?: http.RequestListener<typeof http.IncomingMessage, typeof http.ServerResponse>): http.Server<typeof http.IncomingMessage, typeof http.ServerResponse> (+1 overload)


This verbose suggestion makes it difficult to read the method’s basic structure.
I would like IntelliSense to show a simplified version, such as:
function createServer(requestListener?: (request: IncomingMessage, response: ServerResponse) => void): Server

There is then an ""updated"" listener, which fires a broadcasting event.
On the front end the Livewire component is listening via Laravel Echo for the updated event, and the chat response is shown to the user.
The problem I have is that the broadcasting event works, but not on the queue. I have tested it via a Console Command and it updates the chat, but when the job is processed on the queue, no update occurs.
I have checked the Herd logs, and again, I can see the event broadcasting when I manually trigger with the Console Command, but no event is broadcasted when the job is processed on the queue.
So:

The job to get the llm response is always successfully processed on the queue when the model is created
The LlmMessage model is always updated successfully by this job, and the response is stored

In order to configure this, I need to include certain settings in app.config.ts, as shown in the image below:

However, I want to avoid hardcoding these values directly in the configuration file. Instead of using environment variables, I would like to fetch these configurations dynamically from an API, allowing me to update them whenever necessary. Since app.config.ts is generated only at build time, is there a way to pass these configurations dynamically?
I came across a potential solution
  const setFBSDKSecrets = async () => {
      const res: SSOType = await API('/auth/get-credentials', {
        method: 'GET',
      })

      Settings.setAppName('myApp')
      Settings.setAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled(false)
      Settings.setAutoLogAppEventsEnabled(false)
    }

    setFBSDKSecrets()

I implemented this by adding the settings there and removing them from app.config.ts. However, when I ran yarn start, I encountered an error stating that the appID is missing:
Error: missing appID in the plugin properties

Can anyone provide solution on how to resolve this issue or suggest a better approach for dynamically configuring Facebook login settings in Expo?

```java
Button customButton = findViewById(R.id.btn_custom);

    FirebaseCrashlytics.getInstance().log(""custom crash log111111"");

The issue is that the custom event doesn't seem to appear in the Firebase Analytics dashboard. I've checked the Firebase console, but I can't find any logs related to the ""MyCustom"" event.

```

The error seems to occur when the input values are not correctly parsed or when the expression is invalid. Here are the steps I've taken to troubleshoot:

1. Ensured that the input dialogs are correctly capturing user input.
2. Checked that the `evaluatePolynomial` method is implemented correctly.
3. Verified that the input values are valid integers.

What could be causing this error, and how can I resolve it to ensure valid input is processed correctly? Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!",2^x and other test cases do not work for summation,"In this code, I am supposed to find out the summation of an equation. x^2 does work, but 2^x, and so does for example, 3^y, doesn't work.

79130607,How to align a button with an input field using Bulma CSS?,"I'm trying to create a search bar using Bulma CSS, but I'm having trouble aligning the search button with the input field. Here's the HTML code I'm using:

  </div>

```

The button and input field are not aligning properly. They appear to be on different lines or have inconsistent spacing. How can I ensure they are aligned correctly using Bulma? Is there a specific class or style I need to apply? Any help would be appreciated!",Why does the Bulma CSS framwork change the z-index on hover?,"I am looking into rendering performance issues of my website and I have found that I get a lot of repaints while just moving the mouse pointer around.
Example: the HTML-Box below the input field and button get a repaint each time I move the mouse pointer (hovering only) between the input and the button in this page (from the official Bulma docs)

I am using the Bulma CSS framework with an ""add-on""-arrangement on some elements. A deeper analysis has show that such buttons and inputs have their z-index changed on hover. The relevant scss code in Bulma is this:
From tools.scss:
  .#{iv.$class-prefix}button,
  .#{iv.$class-prefix}input,
  .#{iv.$class-prefix}select select {
    &:not([disabled]) {
      &:hover,
      &.#{iv.$class-prefix}is-hovered {
        z-index: 2;
      }

      &:focus,
      &.#{iv.$class-prefix}is-focused,
      &:active,
      &.#{iv.$class-prefix}is-active {
        z-index: 3;

        &:hover {
          z-index: 4;
        }
      }
    }
  }

What is the logic behind such a z-index change on hover?
It's causing a ton of repaints on my quite complex website. Do other CSS frameworks have a similar function? I am tempted to remove/neuter these z-index changes.

I attempted to install and reference System.Memory in my .NET 8 project, expecting this to resolve the error thrown by ClosedXML when using the XLWorkbook class.

79139431,Why are object properties undefined in my React component's console output?,"I'm working on a React project and I'm encountering an issue where certain properties of an object are showing up as `undefined` in the console. I'm using the Chrome DevTools to debug.

Here's the relevant part of the console output:

```javascript
userGang.members: 
[
  {username: undefined, role: undefined},
  {username: undefined, role: undefined}
]
```

The `userGang` object is supposed to have `members` with defined `username` and `role` properties. However, they are showing as `undefined`. The rest of the `userGang` object seems to be populated correctly:

```javascript
Entire userGang object: 
{
  id: 31,
  name: ""elton john"",
  leader_id: 25,
  members: [{...}, {...}],
  user_id: 25
}

I've checked the data source and the properties should be populated. What could be causing these properties to be `undefined`? Could it be an issue with how I'm fetching or setting the data in my component? Any insights or troubleshooting steps would be appreciated.

Additional context:
- I'm using React with functional components.
- The data is fetched from an API and stored in a state variable.
- The issue persists even after refreshing the data.

Thank you!",Cant print username on react,"Im developing Fullstack React Web App project. In a component (which includes many stuff) cant display the username properly. And when i do other functions are broken. What is the problem on my codes and how can i fix it ?
In planning to create a gang component with fully capable of; create gang, promote-demote user, disband, quit(for members), fire members. And it will display the members for whom a member of. Is user not in a gang, it will fetch the avaible gangs and user can request join.
Its using store and zustand. I was trying to work it out for days and AI involved but i cant solve the problem. The usernames on the Gangs page not shown neither roles(promote-demote stuff). Its bigger than project now. It was on file so i seperated but its still same. If required/wanted i can share my zustand/store too.
If any editor readings this for approval i kindly ask for optimization for this question. Im really cozy head right now. Would you please help me to improve my question and make it more clear ? Is it too complex or not enough sharing ? I dont think its backend related because i see the names before and backend is simple and on console.log i can print.

79139703,How to Resolve 403 Forbidden Error in Blazor WebAssembly Application?,"I'm developing a Blazor WebAssembly application and encountered an issue when trying to render a component. The console shows the following error:

```
crit: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Rendering.WebAssemblyRenderer[100]
      Unhandled exception rendering component: Response status code does not indicate success: 403 (Forbidden).
System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: Response status code does not indicate success: 403 (Forbidden).
```

The error occurs in the `Stickers.razor` file at line 110, specifically in the `OnInitializedAsync` method. It seems to be related to an HTTP request that is being blocked with a 403 status code.

Here are some details about my setup:
- Blazor WebAssembly
- The error occurs during the initialization of a component
- The HTTP request is likely being made to a protected resource

What could be causing this 403 Forbidden error, and how can I resolve it? Are there specific configurations or permissions I need to check? Any guidance on troubleshooting this issue would be greatly appreciated.",How can I show an unauthorized view when HttpClient gets 403 from calling API in .NET Blazor Web Assembly?,"Basically here is my scenario that I'm going to achieve:

I have two users: A and B, A has the permission to access my Restful API developed with ASP.NET Core Web API, B doesn't have the permission to access that API resource (API will return 403)
In my Blazor Web Assembly app, there is a page which will read data from this Restful API, so, I would like when A user logs in, s/he can access this page correctly, but when B logs in, since B doesn't have the access to the API, therefore, when the page is loading and reading data from API, the page will get 403 error and should instead show something like ""You don't have permission to access the page""

So, in the OnInitializedAsync method of the Blazor page, it uses injected IHttpClientFactory to create an HttpClient, and makes a call to the API:
using var httpClient = HttpClientFactory.CreateClient(""stickersHttpClient"");
var httpResponseMessage = await httpClient.GetAsync($""api/stickers?page={pageNumber}&size={pageSize}"");
httpResponseMessage.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
var responseJson = await httpResponseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
PageContent = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<StickersPage>(responseJson);

If it is user B who opens this page, the httpClient.GetAsync will definitely return 403 error, but instead of showing a ""You don't have permission to view this page"" error on the page, the page actually reported an error in the console:

I have already applied @attribute [Authorize] on the page, and in the App.razor it has the following authorized view settings:
<CascadingAuthenticationState>
    <Router AppAssembly=""@typeof(App).Assembly"">
        <Found Context=""routeData"">
            <AuthorizeRouteView RouteData=""@routeData"" DefaultLayout=""@typeof(MainLayout)"">
                <NotAuthorized>
                    @if (context.User.Identity?.IsAuthenticated != true)
                    {
                        <RedirectToLogin />
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        <p role=""alert"">You don't have permission to view this page.</p>
                    }
                </NotAuthorized>
            </AuthorizeRouteView>
            <FocusOnNavigate RouteData=""@routeData"" Selector=""h1"" />
        </Found>
        <NotFound>
            <PageTitle>Not found</PageTitle>
            <LayoutView Layout=""@typeof(MainLayout)"">
                <p role=""alert"">Sorry, there's nothing at this address.</p>
            </LayoutView>
        </NotFound>
    </Router>
</CascadingAuthenticationState>

I think there should be some gap between the API and the page, there should be the way allowing my razor page to ""know"" about the 403 returned by the API so that it could apply the routed authentication view. But I don't know how can I do that.
(By the way, the authorization of the user is done against Keycloak with the policy based on user roles)

79146127,SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module in Jest test,"I'm encountering a `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` when running my Jest tests. The error points to an import statement in my `index.js` file:

The error occurs when I run my test suite using Jest. Here are some details about my setup:

- I'm using Node.js and Jest for testing.
- The error appears in the Jest runtime, specifically in `node_modules/jest-runtime/build/index.js`.

The error message states: ""Hydration failed because the server rendered HTML didn't match the client. As a result, this tree will be regenerated on the client. This can happen if a SSR-ed Client Component used.""

The error suggests several potential causes, such as:

- Server/client branch using `if (typeof window !== 'undefined')`.
- Variable input like `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` changing each time.
- Date formatting issues due to locale differences.
- External changes to data without a snapshot.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

I've checked my `package.json` and it seems like the package might not be installed. I tried running `npm install @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu` but the issue persists.

Here’s the error I get when I try to use ShadCN UI’s DropdownMenu component:
Module not found: Can't resolve '@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu'
Steps to Reproduce
Clone the latest Vercel Commerce template (Next.js 15).
Install ShadCN UI following the official documentation.
Import and try to use any ShadCN UI component, such as DropdownMenu.
The error appears, preventing the app from compiling.
What I’ve Tried
Removing node_modules and pnpm-lock.yaml, then reinstalling dependencies.
Testing ShadCN UI with a simple Next.js 15 project (without Vercel Commerce); it works fine.
Adding @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu directly to package.json, but it didn’t resolve the issue.
Environment

Next.js Version: 15.0.0-rc.1
Package Manager: pnpm
Vercel Commerce Template: Latest version after Next.js 15 update

Expected Behavior
ShadCN UI should work as expected with the Vercel Commerce template, just like it did with the previous version of Next.js
Question
Is this a known compatibility issue between Radix UI in ShadCN and Vercel Commerce’s dependency versions? If so, are there any workarounds, or will I need to modify dependencies manually to get these components working together?
Additional Info
I’ve noticed that Radix UI components are deeply embedded in ShadCN, which may be causing version conflicts in the Vercel Commerce template. Any guidance on resolving this conflict would be helpful
